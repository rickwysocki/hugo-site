A few weeks ago, I went to see Alex Garland's film /Men/. I really enjoyed it, especially in the context of my growing interest in both film genre studies and the specific genre of horror.

Genre is notoriously tricky to pin down as a concept, not least so because it's often referred to in different ways in different conversations. I take genre as a category that influences the expectations of the producers and receivers of art. Genre affects how filmmakers structure their work and what audiences should expect from that work.

Rick Altman wrote in /Film/Genre/ that genres tend to be approached through four operative metaphors:

- as a *blueprint* for industry practices,
- as a *structure* expected by the audience,
- as an industry *label* used to market and communicate the film,
- and as a *contract* of expectations between filmmakers and audiences (14).

Too often, however, critics tend to approach genres in reductive ways. Altman devotes most of his book to identifying and correcting these errors. One of his central concerns is that critics often make sweeping claims about entire genres based on a relatively small collection of films (24). Rather than saying anything about the genre of horror itself, then, I'll just make a few comments about how *Men* repurposes some existing /expectations/ about horror films in interesting ways.

/Men/'s "birthing scene," I imagine is what will linger in most viewers' minds. It feels informed by /Alien,/ which similarly focuses on the grotesque-maternal. Whereas the latter film narrates an external threat (the Alien), /Men/ locates the terrifying presence as interior to human / social masculinity. Barry Langford wrote that horror has largely shifted from an interior to an exterior focus, external terror having lost much of its fright value (178). It's worth noting that he wrote this /before/ the invention of the "A24 Film," which might have taken this interiorization toward its limit.

/Men/ is aware of the expectations viewers bring to a horror picture. Horror films often narrate anxieties related to changing gender roles as well as social difference, more broadly. As Langford noted, horror traditionally reflects an ideological ambiguity, both allowing for the "unmasking" of repressed actions but also the eventual restoration of the "status quo" (159). Vivian Sobchack, similarly, argued that both horror and sci-fi fictionalize "the Other" and the breakdown of the gendered fantasy of the home-as-castle (8). /Men/ certainly seems invested in both of these genre elements.

But the film also departs from horror genre expectations. Harper refuses to carry out her contracted obligation with the audience to murder James with the axe, and this is--frankly--far more interesting than the shock of the birthing scene.

In horror, "normality" is often found by re-integrating monstrous elements (Langford 172); the protagonist usually needs to "become the monster" in order to destroy it. In /Scream V/, for example, Sam's relation to Billy Loomis is revealed and she becomes, herself, righteously murderous.

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt Scream's Sam Carpenter, played by Melissa Barrera.
[[file:men/scream-sam.jpg]]

Juxtapose this against Garland's film. /Men/ introduces the axe early and sets up the expectation that it will be used early in the film. In the end, that expectation is swiftly refused. We see the axe in the first act of the movie and say: "Oh, I know where this will go: This is a horror movie, and somebody is going to get axed." Instead, at the end of the film Harper sits beside the monster / James, exhausted. Asking him what he wants, James responds, "Your love." The scene cuts to the next day and Riley (Harper's friend whom she has been communicating with via FaceTime during this whole... ordeal) arrives, pregnant. Harper smiles.

What was the central message of the film? Not only is misogyny dangerous (it is), but it's exhausting, embarrassing, and childish. The gender lines are blurred in /Men/ to show that masculinity's danger ultimately lies in its ineffectiveness. Harper's ex-boyfriend and the monster are presented as a masculinity in death throes, oscillating between aggression and physical abuse, on one hand, and pathetic social impotence, on the other. Both main villains (to the extent that they are separate) are shown crying like spoiled children when Harper does not acquiesce to their sexual and "romantic" demands.

/Men/ doesn't oblige the audience's expectation for a violent, righteous resolution of the plot. Because, maybe, that expectation itself is part of the film's critique.

A more cynical viewer would likely have guessed that /Men,/ by virtue of it being a "cool" A24 film, wouldn't follow the typical script for genre resolution. In this movie, though, Harper's refusal and the revelation of Riley's non-grotesque pregnancy feel fitting. If Sobchack is correct that a central feature of horror is articulating the figure of the child with a radical, transformed, and horrific vision of the future (11), Harper's (and the film's) refusal seems to suggest an alternate future, yet to unfold.

:END:
I've been watching some anime over the past few weeks. Anime has always been entertaining and interesting to me, but I've generally been hesitant to dive too deep into it. Without caricaturing some of the US fans of anime (you know the ones), I can broadly say that I've just been a bit uncomfortable about the extent to which white Americans... throw themselves at particular elements of Japanese culture, and in turn throw those representations around as though they were offering some sort of authoritative perspective on the nation because, well, they watch a lot of anime.

But that critique has its problems, too. One reason is that, according to cultural anthropologist Ian Condry, Japan has intentionally amplified anime's global reach and seems to see its popularity (which begets forms of appropriation) as a nationalistic boon. Japanese government officials have gone so far as to use anime characters popular in China as ambassadors for Japanese interests. Something Condry notes, though, is that these techniques are unlikely to be successful because anime viewers develop cultural, not political attachments to the art form (18-19). This must be at least some of the soil in which the seeds of very weird forms of cultural appropriation can be planted.

It would also be wrong to simply ignore a transnational art form based on the weirdness of a certain segment of its proponents. With that in mind, I've been trying to fill in some of the gaps in "must-see" anime films and shows and slowly move toward a better understanding of their appeal. I've also been reading scholarship about anime, its history, and how it deviates from animation in the United States. It's frequently observed that tensions between tradition and modernity are often central to anime. In my recent viewing, I've noticed those tensions in works like "Attack on Titan," /My Neighbor Totoro,/ and much of Studio Ghibli's /oeuvre/ more generally.

In "Attack on Titan," for example, the Eldians literally see themselves as the only remaining human population. Their lives are marked by mostly pre-modern technologies and modes of life. Only later do the characters learn that the world is far more expansive and technologically developed, shocked by modern wonders like the automobile and ice cream. "Attack on Titan" uses this tension in an aggressive and extreme fashion, commenting on the legacies of nationalism and global conflict. It is notable, though, that nearly all of the show's major characters have European names. I need to read more of the commentary surrounding the show (and, unfortunately, wait for its upcoming season), but it feels wrong to assume that it is an allegory for Japanese history. Rather it seems more focused on the brutality of war and the human condition and, perhaps more specifically, the violent history of the /Western/ world. Again, these are only initial interpretations.

Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli films also highlight tensions between tradition and modernity but in a far different fashion. From a genre perspective, "Attack on Titan" highlights the tension through the perspective of the war film and body horror, whereas Miyazaki typically does so through the lens of fantasy. Still, Ghibli's films nearly always assume a political stance, one example being the frequent use of "sentient landscapes" as a metaphor for human effects on and relationship with the earth (Napier 162).

In a book chapter by Susan J. Napier, she notes that the Japanese term /satoyama/ is often at the heart of Studio Ghibli films: "literally the place where village meets mountain, but more generally the space in which human and nature interconnect" (Napier 66). Whereas Miyazaki often employs /satoyama/ to show the need for ecologically sustainable life patterns, it could be argued that "Attack on Titan" also narrates the line between humans and nature, nature being where the titans largely exist and, metaphorically, where human beings violent tendencies manifest. To a degree, /satoyama/ seems to correspond to the frontier trope, discussed in a [recent](/film/masculinity-shane-and-yojimbo/) post on the Western and the samurai film.

And yet, "Attack on Titan" and Miyazaki both avoid clearly demarcating "good vs. evil" in their portrayals of modernity and tradition. This is especially true in "Attack on Titan," as plenty of human violence takes place within the city walls. By refusing binary portrayal these works exemplify Napier's observation that while US animation offers more Manichean themes, Japanese animation studios, by contrast, often present more complicated views of the human condition (Napier 168).

:END:
Last night I watched two apocalyptic films. Both Nicholas Ashe Bateman's
/The Wanting Mare/ and Adam McKay's /Don't Look Up/ note that the world
seems to be moving toward catastrophe. While the /The Wanting Mare/
imagines an ambiguous future in a fantastical post-apocalyptic city,
/Don't Look Up/ satirically reflects our present world in the face of an
incoming comet--a perhaps too-on-the-nose "planet-killer." Neither film
is perfect, but each suggests a similar conclusion: in a senseless
world, codependence is the only way to find meaning.

/The Wanting Mare/ follows a multigenerational family of women who dream
of a world that existed before an unnamed apocalyptic event. Most of the
story takes place in a devastated city called Whithren where wild horses
are caught and exported to another city across the sea called Levithen.
Whithren is devastated, and much of the narrative centers on the curious
detail that is possible to acquire a one-way ticket to Levithen
alongside the horses on an export ship. These tickets are so rare that
the people of Whitren regularly kill and are killed for them.

I'll avoid saying more and spoiling the plot. Described in quite a few
online reviews I read as a "tone poem," /The Wanting Mare/ excels in
/ambiance/. Its insistent and, at times, frustrating lack of both
dialogue and plot exposition makes it difficult to put it into words. (I
learned this in an earlier, much longer draft of this post, from which
I've spared you.)

Against the ambient and labyrinthine style of /The Wanting Mare/, the
aggressive satire in McKay's /Don't Look Up/ (which I watched
immediately after) gave me whiplash. I could practically hear the movie
saying:

#+begin_quote
  This comet is climate change! Stop ignoring it! Stop letting
  politicians ignore it!
#+end_quote

There's value to the political messaging in the movie and its critique
of modern life. And I share many of the perspectives offered in the
movie. But I can't help feeling oversells "how dumb everything is"
(think /Idiocracy,/
[[https://www.vice.com/en/article/bn3vgv/idiocracy-is-elitist-porn][which
is bad]]) over its more subtle themes. This is always the bargain
involved in turning politics into art, which more often enervates than
accelerates change, and most often has no effect at all.

What's more interesting about /Don't Look Up/ is that throughout nearly
the entire narrative the catastrophic event has not yet occurred. But it
feels so much more determined, so much more possible, than whatever it
is that actually, already destroyed the world in /The Wanting Mare/.
This is largely due to McKay's realism and the directness of the
commentary juxtaposed against the subtle, fantastical, elements
presented by Bateman. And McKay is right: it is difficult to argue
against the dire position we're in.

But Bateman's movie dares to hope and to find hope in human connections,
relationships, and histories. Which is not to say that McKay doesn't get
there as well. Anyone who has watched /Don't Look Up/ knows that there
is only one thing there before "the end." And if you've watched /The
Wanting Mare/ you hope they'll be there after, too.

:END:

In graduate school, I took a course on film genre. I enjoyed the class,
but I wish I'd engaged with it more. At the time, it felt a bit more
like an "elective," unrelated to my dissertation research on LGBTQ
social movement rhetoric. This was a mistake. It may be specific to my
field, and it's almost certainly tied to the current academic job
market, but I've noticed that graduate students (myself included)
over-professionalize and over-specialize, often extremely early in their
Ph. D.

With 20-20 hindsight, I've been going through some of my notes from that
film genre class. It was well-designed: each week, we watched two or
three films from a particular genre and read a bit of genre theory to
help us understand them. Often, the films crossed nations or other sorts
of borders, showing just how complicated film genre can be.

One week, we watched /Shane/ and /Yojimbo/ as cross-cultural examples of
the Western, which is historically connected to the samurai film in
Japan. Both films are titled based on the names of their protagonists
and, in each case, the narrative focuses on a male figure entering a
town on a "frontier." Barry Langford noted that within the Western genre
the frontier depicts a sort of between-ness, "not a clear boundary
but . . . uncertain and shifting" (63). This is apparent in both /Shane/
and /Yojimbo/, each film narrating a man in a transforming social
environment, mediating between the "old" and the "new."

The "man" of it all is important. Both films rely on a return--or at
least an echo--of a supposedly "authentic" masculinity. The first battle
between Seibei and Ushitora illustrates this: Yojimbo sits on a tower
laughing as the two gangs scare each other but are unable to actually
fight. Alternatively, Shane explains to Joey that a real gunfighter only
needs one pistol (setting himself apart from the "Black hat" villain who
uses two) and later relates to Marion that guns are mere tools to be
used by good or bad men. /Yojimbo/ takes a similar stance, one step
removed: the sword wielded by the good man is juxtaposed against the
villain with the pistol.

There are, of course, important contextual differences in these films'
representations of masculinity. As Randy P. Schiff wrote, /Yojimbo/ is
invested in Japanese class identity and in "a credit economy that has
advanced nearly to the point where it will destroy the social role of
the samurai itself" (66). By contrast, the social struggle in /Shane/ is
marked more heavily by ideologies of land and private property. Each
hero embodies ideological features of their respective country,
mediating changing historical contexts and relations.

I read something fascinating in Rick Altman's book that I discussed in
[[/posts/2022/06/men-2022/][another recent post]]. He talked about two
ways that critics tend to look at films. These are as ritual or as
ideology. He wrote:

#+begin_quote
  Whereas ritual critics interpret narrative situations and structural
  relations as offering /imaginative/ solutions to society's real
  problems, ideological critics see the same situations and structures
  as luring audiences into accepting /deceptive/ non-solutions, while
  all the time serving governmental or industry purposes (Altman 27).
#+end_quote

In other words, we might think of movies as: - art that helps us deal
with our collective problems. - as the product of an industry interested
in squeezing money out of us and maybe delivering some social propaganda
along the way.

I don't mean to mock the latter position. I'm fairly receptive to it.
But in the interest of making some of these ideas as understandable as
possible, that's generally what is meant by the term "ideology," even if
folks who use the term have more complicated ways of explaining it.

Altman makes another interesting comment, though: Both ritual-critics
and ideology-critics tend to focus on largely the same movies.
Typically, these are Hollywood movies. Altman suggests that the reason
Hollywood movies are so successful is that they encourage /both/ types
of interpretations. The same can be said of superhero movies today.

I searched a bit and tried to find an example of a ritual explanation.
[[https://tmff.net/why-are-superhero-films-so-popular/][Julian Leu...
kind of fit the bill]]. Close enough, anyway. He wrote:

#+begin_quote
  Our fondness for stories cannot be denied. And with a superhero
  setting, it is easy to engineer a clear story structure that allows
  for a facile understanding of the matters at hand and facilitates the
  supply of fast-paced entertainment. In such a context, the bad guys
  are clearly defined, and so are the good guys. The latter are expected
  to do battle against the former and win -- whether they do it in the
  name of justice, for a loved one or for personal fame and honour,
  there will be plenty of fights, explosions, betrayals and special
  effects along the way. With a simple story which appeals to a wide
  audience, one that usually ends on a positive note and charges the
  viewers with positive energy and some degree of self-confidence, it's
  easy to understand the success of such films. They're essentially
  tales about people who can do things that we mere mortals never will,
  stories of right versus wrong, of triumph (and occasionally tragedy).
  A critical eye might frown at the too similar plot lines, lackluster
  writing and childish motivations of the characters, but the appeal to
  a low common denominator is undoubtedly high.
#+end_quote

In other words, superhero films give us rituals for viewing social
problems and how they might be solved through acts of heroism. Good will
always triumph over evil.

A ritualist reading might go further, that everyday individuals like us
can take action on those problems. The recent Spider-Man installments
are a good example, which take great pains to point out that Peter
Parker is just a normal high-school kid. Still, he sees injustice and
/does something./

{{< figure src="tom-holland.jpg" alt="Tom Holland as Peter Parker in
science class. He is wearing protective glasses." caption="You, too, can
prevent birds / your girlfriend's dad from attacking society, or
whatever.">}}

Leu's explanation still has elements of an ideological reading.
Honestly, it was hard to find one that didn't without just looking at
Reddit comments or fandom pages. Purely ritualistic readings are less in
fashion these days, and critique is more valued. Discussing this would
take a separate blog post and, to be honest, I'm not particularly
interested in writing it. Nonetheless, consider Leu's commentary above
in contrast to
[[https://deadline.com/2014/10/birdman-director-alejandro-gonzalez-inarritu-writers-interview-852206/][Alejando
Iñárittu's scathing critique of superhero movies' ideological bent]]:

#+begin_quote
  I think there's nothing wrong with being fixated on superheroes when
  you are 7 years old, but I think there's a disease in not growing up.
  The corporation and the hedge funds have a hold on Hollywood and they
  all want to make money on anything that signifies cinema [....]
  Basically, the room to exhibit good nice films is over. These are
  taking the place of all those things [....] I sometimes enjoy them
  because they are basic and simple and go well with popcorn. The
  problem is that sometimes they purport to be profound, based on some
  Greek mythological kind of thing. And they are honestly very right
  wing. I always see them as killing people because they do not believe
  in what you believe, or they are not being who you want them to be. I
  hate that, and don't respond to those characters. They have been
  poison, this cultural genocide, because the audience is so overexposed
  to plot and explosions and shit that doesn't mean nothing about the
  experience of being human.
#+end_quote

There's things that are easy to criticize here. For one, it comes across
as pretty elitist, and it seems to imagine a fantasy world where
Hollywood that existed /before/ big business.

Still, there does seem to be something disturbing about literal
superhumans who, film after film, bend reality to their will. Often,
these films frame violence as a sort of noble and just power. From an
ideological reading, superheroes demonstrate relate to Karl Rove's
often-forgotten and incredibly unsettling justification for the Iraq
war:

#+begin_quote
  We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And
  while you're studying that reality---judiciously, as you will---we'll
  act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and
  that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors . . . and you,
  all of you, will be left to just study what we do.
#+end_quote

So which stance is correct? From my perspective, neither. No one but the
bleakest of the bleak critic would bother watching films if there were
no joy to be had from them, and part of that enjoyment stems from seeing
how our reality can be depicted in art. Even if we disagree with that
depiction.

At the same time, it's undeniable that movies are market-driven--not
least so because they're so expensive to make. And you would be
hard-pressed to argue that films don't assume stances on social issues
that might in some cases be referred to as propagandistic. And these
same films can still be good.

It's more interesting to shuffle between the two perspectives. I might
not be the audience for every superhero movie, and I have my own
critiques of the worldviews that they represent. At the same time, I
found it interesting and enjoyable that the recent Dr. Strange movie
assumed many genre features of horror, and many of the horror features
seemed informed by a need to process some of our recent difficulties as
a national and a global society. You know the ones.

A concept that has been popping up in recent posts is genre. It's not
surprising, as genre is central not only to film--one of my main
interests--but to rhetoric and writing studies, my academic field. But
what /is/ genre?

Like most concepts that are obvious and apparent to the general public,
genre has been complexified by academics in ways both productive and
unproductive. Readers of other posts have likely noticed my skepticism
toward academic discourse. But this skepticism has less to do with the
common criticisms of overly-fancified writing and more to do with the
circulation (or lack thereof) of said writing. I am, as it is sometimes
pejoratively called in the academy, a "theory bro," but only because I
think theory has something to offer, not because I think it's the way
toward a rewarding academic career. To offer something, though, ideas
need to circulate.

So, this post will take a "beginner's mind" approach to the concept of
genre. I'll start with an idea that seems simple and discuss its value
in understanding texts, art, and cultural production.

My overall point: Genre is a method of classification.

We all have a sense of what classifications are. It's a nice word for
sorting stuff. When we look at our books and weigh whether to sort them
by author, by title, or by color, we're considering classifications.
When we listen to RapCaviar on Spotify, we assume that the songs all fit
our classification scheme for rap. When we think about what movie we
want to go see in the theaters, classifications like "horror," "action,"
and "romance" help us make decisions about which film to choose.

Often, we take classifications at face value. It would be somewhat
taxing, every time we put on a movie, to first go and research all of
the different decisions that went into classifying it. Yet, this work is
a necessary part of classifying. As Geoffrey C. Bowker and Susan Leigh
Star pointed out, classifications are invisible until people start
arguing about them (Bowker and Star 2).

It's easier to simply accept that we know what Hip-Hop is until Drake
puts out /Honestly, Nevermind/ and everyone notices that it's a House
album. But it's on RapCaviar. And it's a central focus of Hip-Hop media.
If you look online, there are a lot of arguments not only about whether
the album is good, but what it is. The classification, the genre, has
become contentious.

But genres aren't /exactly/ the same as classifications. They're
different words, after all. Honestly, though, I find it difficult to
sort out the two terms. In popular use, genres are clearly used to parse
classifications of art. Musical genres, film genres, and literary genres
seem like the most familiar employments of the term--maybe in that
order.

But, as always, scholars have made the term more complex. And, as
always, this has positives and negatives. In rhetoric and writing
studies, a broad overview would reveal genres as ways to classify
different types of communication--both oral and written.

Carolyn Miller, arguably the definitional figure in what's been termed
rhetorical genre studies (or, sometimes North American genre studies),
claimed that genres are better understood as a way we "do things" with
our communication. We rely on our knowledge of genre when we write, say,
a workplace memo in order to make that memo successful. One of the
examples I use for my students is asking them to consider appealing to
their boss for a raise, but instead of a formal letter, writing them a
poem. The content could be exactly the same, but if it were written in
stanzas, it would break the boss's genre expectations, which depend on a
range of contextual factors in the workplace. The classification would
become contentious.

Miller argues that genres aren't just taxonomies but ways of analyzing
communications based on audiences and contexts (49). I agree, though I
sometimes feel that her perspective underemphasizes the ways that genres
are /used/ in taxonomic ways. Understanding genre relies on a sort of
taxonomic fantasy: we know that every horror movie will be different,
but we have an imagined sense that all horror movies share "something"
that ties them all together. This something may be a set of shared
features or a prototype example (Bowker and Star 62-63), but genres (and
classifications generally) are like asymptotes: they can approach a
coherent "grouping"--and be highly useful as they do--but never fully
achieve it. Something will always "slip out" of the genre; difference
will always emerge.

What is decidedly not fantastical, though, is that industry practices
absolutely rely on the audience's expectations for coherent genres.
Further, those same practices also produce those expectations. Consider
two ways of looking at film genres offered by Rick Altman.

1. Critics will usually /begin with an awareness of an already existing
   genre/, think about which films are /already discussed as examples of
   this genre/, and analyze their shared features. This perspective may
   be interesting, but it doesn't actually explain much about where the
   genre comes from in the first place. It leaves out the /work/ of how
   the classification came to be.

2. By contrast, producers /begin with an already successful film./ They
   say to themselves: "Hey, I would like to make more of that sweet,
   sweet money." They replicate aspects of the film that were
   well-received in new productions, gradually building up the
   audience's expectations for repeated motifs, themes, and formulas
   across films. Eventually, a classification emerges in the form of a
   genre to market these films, usually branching out from an
   already-existing genre (Altman 38). The genre classification, from
   this perspective, is a result of both the work of industrial
   practices and the emerging audience expectations. The fantasy of
   taxonomy emerges at the end of this process a market for the film
   industry.

Obviously, genres are useful. They help us make decisions about films to
see, about books to read, about music to listen to, etc. Yet, as much
scholarship has tried to point out, looking at their histories forces us
to consider just how "objective" a genre classification could ever be.
Beyond academic discourse, why is this useful or interesting? I'll offer
a few points in relation to film.

- Making genre classifications contentious can help us see when
  individual films are doing something interesting or different within
  their /own/ marketed genres, as I discussed in
  [[/posts/2022-06-05-men/][my recent post on /Men/.]]
- We can better understand how our own perspectives on genres have been
  shaped by our film experiences and how we (often unconsciously)
  classify films based on those experiences. We can take this both in
  terms of how industries have shaped our ideological expectations AND
  as a way of pointing out just how rich and diverse the history of film
  truly is. [[/posts/2022-06-09/heroes-ritual-ideology/][We don't have
  to choose.]]
- Finally, and this certainly deserves its own post in the future, the
  history of genre classifications is often, itself, the content of
  films, and a better understanding of genre can enrich our appreciation
  of those films.

:END:

Well. I made it several years into the Covid-19 pandemic without
catching the virus. Unfortunately, my time has come.

Having a mildly sore throat and a small cough, I thought I'd gotten a
small common cold. It was the first time I'd been sick, at all, during
the pandemic, so even this small slight to my health seemed greatly
annoying.

I figured I should take a test anyway and, lo and behold: Covid-19. I
could swear those pink and blue lines were on the test strip before I
even dunked it in the fluid.

There are a few "silver linings" so far. First, my fiancé tested
negative. I'm writing this quarantined in my home office with an air
mattress and some other comforting items. These include my gaiwan and
pu'erh tea, my Kindle, and my zazen cushion. My only goal at this point
is to hopefully avoid spreading it to A.

Second, both A and I are vaccinated and boosted.

Third, while I definitely feel sick, the symptoms have been fairly
manageable so far. My cough and sore throat /have/ gotten worse. But not
much worse. And while I've certainly felt feverish and ache-y throughout
the day, it's been relatively mild, all things considered.

I figure: why not document my time with Covid-19? Just post a couple of
notes each day with how I'm feeling and what I'm doing.

A few things I'd like to achieve while I'm stuck in this room for the
time being:

- Finish responding to student projects and submit grades. That's right;
  I got Covid during the week of final grade submission.
- Do one or two mini / solo zazen retreats.
- Read a book or two. I actually just finished one.
- Watch some movies.

That's all for now.

In sick solidarity,

Rick

My second day of Covid. The good news: A tested this morning and so far
continues to come up negative. The bad news: I feel like butt.

I was happily able to get a fair amount of sleep last night. It was only
my absolutely scorched throat that woke me a few times. Today, though,
my symptoms have gotten quite a bit worse. I still feel within the realm
of "really bad cold / flu," but it is not fun.

The worst part, though expected, is that I lost my senses of smell and
taste today. It's quite odd to smell and taste a jar of peanut butter,
one minute, and then only minutes later find it, or yourself, lifeless
in flavor and fragrance.

Just to be sure, I took the nuclear option and squirted a bunch of hand
sanitizer onto my palm. Taking a big huff (no, I didn't taste it) burned
my nostrils. But, if asked, I wouldn't have been able to tell what
caused the pain if it wasn't myself that concocted this weird test. I
don't recommend it.

I made some solid efforts toward responding to students' papers. In an
ideal situation, I'll be done with the fall semester tomorrow. In a
realistic one, it will probably be Sunday.

Before bed last night, I watched /Rambo/. Not having seen a Rambo film
since I was a young kid, I expected it to be a shoot-em-up action film.
It was. It also wasn't. Maybe I'll write up more thoughts at another
time.

I'm getting quite bored. After this, I'll sit zazen for a bit. Then
maybe watch a movie.

With phlegm,

Rick

I do hope that these posts don't communicate: "pity me!" With the
devastation that Covid has brought on folks and families, I'm incredibly
lucky to have gotten it a) this late and b) so fully vaccinated. Please
know that these posts are more of a personal timestamp than anything
meant to be read.

Day three has been alright so far. Last night, again, my only issue
sleeping was my wrecked throat. A bought me some chloraseptic today; I
imagine that will help tonight.

The NyQuil I took last night gave me some very strange dreams. One of
them included a visit to my Zen center that involved a buffet of beef
brisket. (In the waking world, the Zen center only serves vegetarian
food.) In the dream, I took too much food and robbed everyone else of a
meal. (Hungry ghosts come to mind.) Then I somehow showed up late to the
sitting portion of the retreat. When I got there, there were hundreds of
unfamiliar people doing walking meditation and reciting an unfamiliar
chant. Weird stuff.

I finished responding to students' work today. Feeling a bit loopy from
DayQuil, I decided to push the actual submission of grades until
tomorrow morning. After that, this semester will be a wrap.

Last night, I started reading William Gibson's /Neuromancer/, a novel I
certainly should have already read. I'm enjoying it so far. I also
watched /The Thirteenth Floor/, a remake of Fassbender's /World on a
Wire./ It didn't have the same charm.

While still fairly bored, I've grown oddly accustomed to this room. A
still tests negative, which is great.

Coughing manageably,

Rick

Today will be a shorter post. Rather than write, I spent most of the day
a) submitting grades and b) working on a new track (see below). But here
are a few quick notes.

- I feel much better today than I have in previous days. And my taste
  and smell have almost entirely returned.
- A's still testing negative. (!)
- A also bought me clam chowder at the store. It was perfect.
- Last night I watched /Twelve Monkeys/. It was extremely odd. I really
  enjoyed it.

Finally, as I said, I spent some time making music in Ableton today,
which was nice. I posted a rough cut of the track to SoundCloud,
embedded below.

Sick-cerely,

Rick

A few months ago, I got tired of dealing with my Jekyll site. That site
was hosted on GitHub pages and used the Minimal Mistakes theme, which I
continue to love. My issue, though, was that using a remote theme that I
didn't quite understand led to ongoing difficulties with deployment.
These, of course, all stemmed from user error.

Frustrated again by a site that wouldn't build or deploy, I said: "Screw
it. I'm going to a readymade option." I chose Ghost.

This platform seemed to have a lot of value:

- It seemed oriented toward writing and content over anything else.
- There are a lot of cool analytics features within the platform.
- It worked.

I was unable to stick with Ghost.

The site worked, for sure. But it didn't give me the kind of granular
control over content that I wanted. Worse, it didn't let me /tinker/,
which is the most important feature of technology, to me.

So, I decided to learn how to create a Hugo site, from scratch.

** Prior Knowledge

   :ID:       1FC4311F-8A6A-468A-A527-4A9A92D0DDFE
   :END:
I went into this project knowing essentially nothing about Hugo except
its branded tagline: "A content manager's dream." That was enough to
hook me in. Sure, I've had tons of experience with HTML, CSS/SCSS, and
the relevant languages and markup syntax involved in Jekyll, like Liquid
and Ruby. But I had no experience with Go, the language on which Hugo is
based, or any of the other relevant aspects of the Hugo framework.

** Current Knowledge

   :END:
I've taught myself... a lot. Over the past several weeks, I've gone from
knowing nothing to having built a pretty much fully functional Hugo
site. It may not look like much, currently being pretty "Bootstrap-y,"
but there's plenty of time to figure that out on a rolling basis.

Here is a list of things I've learned and / or built into this site
during this process:

- Pretty much all of the methods of image processing available in Hugo.
  I put this first because it was probably the most difficult aspect of
  the project, requiring the most head-scratching and figuring out how
  Go works as a language. All of the images across the site are sized
  automatically to increase the page-load time. That's pretty cool.
- Lots (lots!) about SEO and what to include as far as metadata goes. I
  knew a fair amount about this, but Minimal Mistakes did a lot of
  things automatically that I didn't understand and had to learn.
- Foregrounding site and page parameters to follow DRY principles as
  much as I possibly could. I plan to release the final version of this
  theme as a project on GitHub, so I've designed this version to be as
  modular, customizable, and user-oriented as possible. More can and
  will be done here, but I'm happy with it so far.
- Lots about Hugo shortcodes. One of my bugbears is writing
  accessible-first markup, as it should be for everyone. It was harder
  than I thought to create the ability to auto-resize images--which
  requires accessing them as global or page resources--and also pass in
  things like alt-text and, as necessary, captions. So, I wrote some
  shortcodes that do just that. Others are less impressive but still
  useful. I'll detail those at a later time.
- While I've used Bootstrap many times in the past, I've never done so
  using NPM. I wanted a deeper level of customizability (you probably
  can't currently tell, to be fair), so I learned how to use the NPM
  version of Bootstrap.
- Finally, I've just spent a lot of time messing around with the Hugo
  way of managing content. There's a lot more to come in that regard
  (see below), but I've learned a lot and am loving it so far.

While I'm happy with all the work I've done here, there are quite a few
things I want to get squared away. Here's a list of what's to come.

- *The visual design.* I know it, you know it; this site looks very
  boring. My next move will be focusing on a visual redesign of some of
  what I have here so far.
- *Bringing in more content.* I'm planning to bring in old posts and
  resources, but relatively slowly. The reason is that I want to be
  exactingly intentional about how I create the content structure for
  what I have here.
- *Release the theme.* The nice thing is that I'm not all that far away
  from this. I'll probably send something up to GitHub once I figure out
  the visual redesign.

Fun stuff! I've learned so much by building this site and developed a
lot of useful new skills.

[[/posts/2023-03-10-hugo/][My previous post]] detailed some of the

still planning to release the final version as a little theme, but just
need to finish getting things squared away on my actual site (here)
first.

I'm going to be working on here include migrating both all my old blog
posts and other material here.

Unrelated to the site, it was my birthday a few days ago. I figured I'd
detail some of the nice things that happened this year.

- A and I got engaged!
- I spent a week at the Rochester Zen Center in sesshin (a Zen method of
  silent, intensive meditation over a period of days). A very
  transformative experience.
- A taught a number of really successful courses.
- I saw a lot of good friends get married.
- Relatedly, A and I were able to do some traveling this past year,
  previously being more locked down due to the pandemic. Looking forward
  to doing more.
- I made a lot of progress in weightlifting, and ran a successful 10k
  the day after my birthday.

These are only a few good things, and a longer list would include lots
more. Next steps this summer include wedding planning!

I'm obsessed with information management. From my research on the
preservation of LGBTQ history in Louisville to my professional and
technical communication teaching that emphasizes tools and technologies
for increased knowledge management and efficiency, I've always been
fascinated by how information management techniques can make life more,
well, manageable. Even my love of Hugo, branded as "a content manager's
dream," reflects this passion.

Information management--here broadly including content
management/strategy, knowledge management, and personal knowledge
management--is often seen as a mundane task that simply sets the stage
for the creative process. To me, though, organizing information is
nine-tenths of the creative process itself. The decisions we make as we
manage the information we come into contact with /are/ the creative
process. "Inspiration" is, really, just a word we came up with to label
their effect.

Serendipity exists, of course. But serendipity has more to do with
creatively setting the conditions for discovery than with the
mythological moment of "eureka." There have been several methods,
processes, and tools offered to set these conditions. One of the most
interesting ones, though, is Nelson's imagined "ELF" system.

** The Evolutionary List File

   :ID:       2C2A58F1-A0E0-46E1-BCB0-A53FEB79A2D2
   :END:
In 1965, Ted Nelson published a paper titled "A File Structure for the
Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate." Beyond coining the word
"hypertext," this paper theorized a system for information management
that Nelson called an Evolutionary List File (ELF). Nelson found
computer programs at the time to underemphasize the iterative and
inventive phases of thinking and writing (136b) and proposed the ELF, "a
file structure that can be shaped into various forms, changed from one
arrangement to another in accordance with the user's changing need"
(137b), as a hypothetical alternative.

At root, the ELF would be a bundle of nested lists, where information
could be quickly stored and accessed. While it was writing-oriented, it
was *not* an outlining system in the way that many list-based writing
tools were and still are today. Instead of creating a hierarchical
outline, an ELF user would iteratively link items together to form new
connections over time (138a). Rather than sorting information into
discrete folders, as we still mainly do today, we would focus instead on
creating connections.

The effects of this system, described by Nelson, would include:

- Affording an ongoing "conversation" between entries, with users
  reviewing content and considering them in new ways.
- Creating an emergent, rhizomatic structure for entries and
  discouraging "fixed," hierarchical thinking.
- Reflecting the patterns of human thought instead of asking users to
  "think" like a computer in their creative processes.

*** ELF and Creativity

    :ID:       2E56B058-3CA6-4CBE-A8EE-FF784CC587D4
    :END:
I find Nelson's structure interesting because it offers such clear
insights into the relationship between technology and creativity that
are still relevant today.

Nelson believed that any storage or writing system that creates friction
with *change and iteration* is fundamentally at odds with creative
practice. He wrote:

#+begin_quote
  Human ideas, science, scholarship, and language are constantly
  collapsing and unfolding. Any field, and the corpus of all fields, is
  a bundle of relationships subject to all kinds of twists, inversions,
  involutions, and rearrangement: these changes are frequent but
  unpredictable. . . . [P]erhaps here, as in biology, the only ultimate
  structure is change itself” (144a, 144b).
#+end_quote

For Nelson, any system of thinking that assumes "/true/ or /ideal/
or /permanent/ codes and categories" is at odds with human thinking and
creative practice. In other words. Categorization is provisional, which
should be reflected in our systems of thinking and writing (144b). The
ELF, though hypothetical at the time, was one way to embrace change in
information management.

** ELF's Value Today

   :ID:       37DD7C69-1184-4810-AB23-F22F90405D40
   :END:
Today, the personal knowledge management movement (PKM) has called more
attention to the problems that Nelson described, sometimes uncannily so.
For example, the Zettelkasten method of note-taking, invented by Niklas
Luhmann and more recently popularized in the note-taking book /How to
Take Smart Notes/, seems almost identical to one comment about ELF made
by Nelson:

#+begin_quote
  By assigning entries to lists, the ELF may be used as a glorified card
  file, with separate lists used for categories, trails, etc. This
  permits extensive cross-indexing by the assignment of one entry into
  different lists. It permits subsets and sub-sequences for any use to
  be held apart and examined without disturbing the lists from which
  they have been drawn, by copying them onto other, new lists. (140a)
#+end_quote

So many of the new conversations in personal knowledge management, such
as Zettelkasten/Smart Notes and the PARA method, focus on the
limitations of file structures that Nelson was identifying in 1965 but
that are still reflected in many of our digital habits today.

Why does all this matter? Creating hierarchies and outlines of
information can be useful, but many don't realize that outlines have to
work on /existing/ material; they are not creative practices themselves
(Nelson 135b). This is why the common myth we tell ourselves and our
students that an outline should be worked on /before/ writing at best
makes little sense and at worst is cruel; how can we outline ideas we
haven't created yet?

Luckily, within the last several years there have been many tools and
strategies that allow individuals to experiment with alternatives to
hierarchical information structures. For example, nearly all of my
creative activity makes use of the Zettelkasten method, with Obsidian
being the main tool. Rather than laying out my full method of
information management--which I surely will at some point--here are a
few resources and tools that have taken up the spirit of Nelson's paper.

* DONE Conditional Image Layouts in Hugo

** Introduction
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: introduction
   :ID:       37C4F311-EE3E-4EAE-BE4A-9A6730158403
   :END:
In this tutorial, I describe how to write conditional image layouts
using [[https://go.dev/][Go]] and HTML for a [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]]
site.

When I started designing
[[https://github.com/rickwysocki/littleGhost][Little Ghost]], my Hugo
theme, I wanted to conditionally insert featured images based on
parameters called in a page's front matter and the site configuration
file. Hugo's
[[https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure][figure
shortcode]] was an option, but I wanted something more automatic. I
learned how easy this can be in Hugo.

** Part 1: Featured Images for Pages (Basic)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: part-1-featured-images-for-pages-basic
   :ID:       046AC676-2115-4C8A-8B58-A2A005C3047E
   :END:
There were several criteria I wanted in to implement for featured image
layouts. I wanted Hugo to:

- Check the page's front matter for a featured image.
- Pull a declared featured image into the layout as a resource.
- Allow the user to include alt text for the image within the front
  matter.

Finally, I wanted this to be *optional*. If no front matter is declared,
no HTML should be rendered for the image layout.

*** Building the Featured Image Layout
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: building-the-featured-image-layout
    :ID:       53668600-7E5D-416D-8B20-B051128BD65B
    :END:
First, let's look at the code/markup. I'll explain each line below.

#+begin_example
  {{ if isset .Params "featured_image" }}

  {{ $image := .Resources.GetMatch .Params.featured_image }}

  <img
      {{ with $image }}src="{{$image.RelPermalink }}"{{end}}
      alt="{{ .Params.featured_alt }}"
  />

  {{ end }}
#+end_example

So, what is each line doing here?

First, we ask Hugo to check whether a =featured_image= is set in the
front matter. If not, everything else will be ignored:

#+begin_example
  {{ if isset .Params "featured_image" }}
#+end_example

Assuming we have declared a featured image, we then want to access it as
a page resource. This is important because, as described in
[[https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-resources/][the Hugo
documentation]], page resource files get a page-relative URL, which
simplifies the front matter we need to write. We will also see that
getting our image as a page resource will let us make creative use of
Hugo's image-processing methods.

So, what we want to do is:

1. Get =featured_image=.
2. Ensure that we are acessing it as a /page resource/.
3. Store the image as a variable that we can use in our page layout.

The next line accomplishes all three of these tasks:

#+begin_example
  {{ $image := .Resources.GetMatch .Params.featured_image }}
#+end_example

We now have our image as a resource, but we haven't created its display.
Let's create create an =<img>= layout that calls in the resource.

First, we'll open (and leave open) the image tag:

#+begin_example
  <img
#+end_example

Then, like any image tag, we need to include the source for the file.
This is easy, since we've called the image as a resource and assigned it
to a variable: we just need to add =.RelPermalink= to get the URL.

The only slight twist is that we need to set the scope for the image's
source permalink carefully so that we can also declare the alt text
using a separate front matter parameter. We will include
={{ with }} ... {{ end }}= around /only/ the =src= line and close the
image tag afterward:

#+begin_example
  <img
      {{ with $image }}src="{{$image.RelPermalink }}"{{end}}
  />
#+end_example

Now, let's also include set up alt text for our image, which can be
declared using the =featured_alt= parameter in the front matter:

#+begin_example
  alt="{{ .Params.featured_alt }}"
#+end_example

Finally, we just need to close the conditional statement we started at
the beginning of the block with ={{ end }}=. Here's the whole block
again:

#+begin_example
  {{ if isset .Params "featured_image" }}

  {{ $image := .Resources.GetMatch .Params.featured_image }}
  <img
      {{ with $image }}src="{{$image.RelPermalink }}"{{end}}
      alt="{{ .Params.featured_alt }}"
  />

  {{ end }}
#+end_example

Once you've written this into your page layout file, *all you'll ever
have to do* is include the following two lines in your page front
matter:

#+begin_example
  ---
  featured_image: image.jpg
  featured_alt: "Your alt text."
  ---
#+end_example

It's that easy!

** Conditional Images and Image Processing in List Pages

   :ID:       256A3783-3E0C-4C95-B37F-6312F60BCF8C
   :END:
We can also expand the basic layout and front matter parameters we
created to write a dynamic and intelligent image layout for a list page.
This page will range over relevant content and return an optimized
featured image. A good example of (actually the best example, since
we'll be recreating a small part of it) is the [[/posts/][Posts page]]
for this website.

*** The Full Markup / Code
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: the-full-markup-code
    :ID:       66A7101A-F506-4C98-9CB9-805975B4B126
    :END:
First, let's look at the markup / code for a /full grid layout/ of blog
posts. Ignore the Tailwind CSS classes, which are irrelevant.

#+begin_example
  {{ range (.Paginate ( .Pages.ByDate.Reverse )).Pages }}

        <article class="p-6 shadow-lg flex flex-col">

          {{ if isset .Params "featured_image" }}

            {{ $image := .Resources.GetMatch .Params.featured_image }}
            <a href="{{ .RelPermalink }}">
              <img
                  {{ with $image }}src="{{ (($image.Crop "1200x800").Resize "600x").RelPermalink }}"{{ end }}
                  alt="{{ .Params.featured_alt }}"/>
            </a>

          {{ else }}

          {{ $image := resources.Get .Site.Params.post_image }}

            <a href="{{ .RelPermalink }}">
              <img 
                  {{ with $image }}src="{{ (($image.Crop "1200x800").Resize "60x").RelPermalink }}" {{ end }} 
                  alt="{{ .Site.Params.post_image_alt }}"
              />
          </a>

          {{ end }}

          <div class="grow">

            <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mt-2"><a href="{{ .RelPermalink }}">{{ .Title }}</a></h3>

            <p class="mb-4">{{ .Params.summary }}</p>

          </div>

          <div>

            <a href="{{ .RelPermalink }}" class="p-2 rounded-lg bg-indigo-600 text-white">Read More</a>
          
          </div>

        </article>

    {{ end }}
#+end_example

To summarize: this code block creates a layout where Hugo will range
over every relevant page and, for each one, produce a grid item
containing: - a featured image, - a summary, - and a "Read More" button.

The main thing you need to understand is that all of this is surrounded
by:

#+begin_example
  {{ range (.Paginate ( .Pages.ByDate.Reverse )).Pages }}

      ...

  {{{ end }}}
#+end_example

What this code broadly states (beyond some pagination information) is
that Hugo is going to range over every relevant page and create whatever
is included between the tags.

*** Back to the Images
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: back-to-the-images
    :ID:       43E9AD14-4D23-463B-BF35-A6599F3A43A1
    :END:
So, back to our focus: the featured image. We /could/ simply copy the
image layout we created above. But we want something beyond the basics.
Specifically:

1. We want all these images to be the same size, automatically, so that
   they look nice together.
2. We want a way to increase page load time. This is going to be a lot
   of images loading on a single list page.
3. We want a backup image even if a page /doesn't/ have a featured image
   assigned. A single page without a featured image is fine, but
   inconsistency on a list page never looks great.
4. We don't want to write any extra front matter beyond what we've
   included for the single layout above.

This is all surprisingly simple. Let's take a closer look at the
image-related part of the markup / code above:

#+begin_example
  {{ if isset .Params "featured_image" }}

      {{ $image := .Resources.GetMatch .Params.featured_image }}

      <a href="{{ .RelPermalink }}">
          <img
              {{ with $image }}src="{{ (($image.Crop "1200x800").Resize "600x").RelPermalink }}"{{ end }}
              alt="{{ .Params.featured_alt }}"
          />
      </a>

  {{ else }}

      {{ $image := resources.Get .Site.Params.post_image }}

      <a href="{{ .RelPermalink }}">
          <img 
              {{ with $image }}src="{{ (($image.Crop "1200x800").Resize "600x").RelPermalink }}" {{ end }}
              alt="{{ .Site.Params.post_image_alt }}"
          />
      </a>

  {{ end }}
#+end_example

Much of this should hopefully look familiar to you now. To summarize the
first half of the block:

1. We're checking to see if a featured image has been set. If it has, we
   call it as a resource into a variable.
2. We're now surrounding the image with an
   =<a href="{{ .RelPermalink }}"></a>= tag so that clicking the image
   takes us to the page itself. Note that how we are still in the page
   scope, so =.RelPermalink= is returning the link to the page, not the
   image.
3. We're including the image source and the correct scope using
   ={{ with $image }}{{ end }}=.
4. We're getting the alt text from the front matter and inserting it
   into the HTML.

Now let's look at the second half, which starts at the ={{ else }}=
line:

#+begin_example
  {{ else }}

      {{ $image := resources.Get .Site.Params.post_image }}

      <a href="{{ .RelPermalink }}">
          <img 
              {{ with $image }}src="{{ (($image.Crop "1200x800").Resize "60x").RelPermalink }}" {{ end }}
              alt="{{ .Site.Params.post_image_alt }}"
          />
      </a>

  {{ end }}
#+end_example

Note that we're calling something different into our variable here:
=.Site.Params.post_image=. What this block is saying is that if a
featured_image *hasn't* been called on a page, Hugo should go get a
default image declared in your configuration file title =post_image=.
Again, you can include also define the alt text there as
=post_image_alt=. In your config file, it would look like this:

#+begin_example
  post_image = 'images/image.png'
  post_image_alt = 'Alt text.'
#+end_example

Note that I'm using a config.toml file, so the specific syntax might
vary since Hugo allows for YAML, TOML, or JSON. This won't have any
effect on the layouts we've created.

*** Processing Our Images
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: processing-our-images
    :ID:       0C3A3DFC-9206-4653-94C2-B5DBC0C5E164
    :END:
We're in the home stretch now. There's one small piece that we haven't
talked about, but it's doing some essential work. Note the methods we've
added when calling our image:

#+begin_example
  {{ (($image.Crop "1200x800").Resize "600x").RelPermalink }}
#+end_example

We're using some of
[[https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/][Hugo's
image-processing methods]] here.

1. Because we wanted equally sized images, we employ the =.Crop= method
   to first take our image and crop it to 1200x800.
2. Because the image will be used in a grid layout where it will be
   smaller, we then resize our cropped image to half size using the
   =Resize= method. This will help with page load time.
3. Finally, we're returning the permalink for the now-processed image.
   You can and should tweak the crop size and the resize to your liking.

** Conclusion
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: conclusion
   :ID:       6A42DFBA-B260-4779-A39E-BFA305C24026
   :END:
Once you've set up these layouts, the only thing you will /ever/ have to
write is: - The =featured_image= and =featured_alt= parameters in your
page front matter. - The default =post_image= and =post_image_alt= in
your config file as a fallback.

Hopefully, this helped you learn something about using creating image
layouts in Hugo. You can focus entirely on your content and let Hugo and
your layouts do the work for you.

    :ID:       3A69060B-6D41-4704-94EB-D07805B23656
    :END:
If you've got this down and want to do more with what you've learned,
here are two small project ideas:

- Rewrite the =<img></img>= layouts using =<figure></figure>= tags. See
  if you can add an optional parameter for =figcaptions=.
- Look over some of the other
  [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/][image
  processing]] methods that Hugo ships with. What other ones might you
  include?

I've been spending time boning up on technical writing skills over the
past few months. As a teacher of professional and technical writing it's
important for me to be able to explain not just the role of language but
also of technology in technical writing. Beyond that, readers of my blog
are aware of my obsession with learning, technology, and learning about
technology.

The specific skills I've been practicing and developing relate to my
interest in the Docs as Code philosophy.
[[https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/][According to Write
the Docs]]: > Documentation as Code (Docs as Code) refers to a
philosophy that you should be writing documentation with the same tools
as code: > > - Issue Trackers > - Version Control (Git) > - Plain Text
Markup (Markdown, reStructuredText, Asciidoc) > - Code Reviews > -
Automated Tests > > This means following the same workflows as
development teams, and being integrated in the product team. It enables
a culture where writers and developers both feel ownership of
documentation, and work together to make it as good as possible.

Specifically, I decided to learn [[https://asciidoc.org/][AsciiDoc]] and
[[https://docs.asciidoctor.org/][AsciiDoctor]] and how these tools
enable single-source authoring across an array of output formats. While
I'm very familiar with some fundamental principles of Docs as Code from
my years using Jekyll and Hugo, it was fun finding ways to use
AsciiDoc's affordances--like attributes and conditionals--to create
sample documents that could output quite differently for different
genres and formats, including print. As a small-scale project, I rewrote
and improved the documentation for
[[https://github.com/rickwysocki/littleGhost][Little Ghost]], my Hugo
theme, using AsciiDoc. You can find that documentation here.

Currently, I'm working my way through Tom Johnson's
[[https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/]["Document APIs: A Guide
for Technical Writers and Engineers."]] I'll be putting together a post
(or, more likely, multiple posts) on working through this tutorial. It's
enough to say that it's challenging (the productive, fun kind) and
really engaging.

Liquid Proust

Drank on April 3, rainy day evening session.

The leaves broke up really nice.

I used 10 grams in 100 ml gaiwan to use up some remaining leaves in the
sample. Flash steeps.

Young puer sour smell on the wet leaves.

Tasted somewhere between a slightly aged and young puer. Could taste the
"grandma's house" notes behind the astringency, similar to Love Forever.

Not too think and not too light of a mouthfeel.

Vegetal and floral. Mossy smell, with grass and hay notes. Sort of like
stepping out of a tent in the woods and smelling the dew.

Somewhat astringent, but surprisingly tame for the 10 gram dose.

A few steeps in I started feeling a very calm and float-y energy. In
steeps past that, it turned radically and become much more energetic.

Strong huigan that emerged a few steeps in and remained even in later
steeps once the tea became lighter.

With a lot going on in my life (positively), I've been a bit slow on
writing posts here. This week, though, I've been doing some work around
the site and figured I'd note a few updates.

--------------

*Portfolio Updates.* I've updated the site with a small but growing
[[/portfolio][portfolio section]]. The three pieces I've included so far
display some of my technical writing chops in a variety of genres and
formats, including updated documentation for my Hugo theme, a technical
article I wrote for Hugo image optimization, and a short tutorial I
wrote for my students on exporting ChatGPT converstations when they use
the tool for writing purposes. (I don't particularly /want/ to write a
post on how ChatGPT is affecting writing pedagogy. But, I probably
will.)

--------------

*Documentation Projects.* I've also been putting the proverbial money in
the area of my mouth lately by contributing documentation to open source
projects on GitHub. I spent a few weeks learning the basics of REST API
documentation using tools like SwaggerUI, cURL, Postman, and Stoplight.
Afterwards, I contributed an OpenAPI specification document that's under
review with its developer, and I've also contributed some smaller-scale
documentation to another project. I hope to pull these into my portfolio
soon, but for now you can check out my
[[https://github.com/rickwysocki][GitHub contributions]] to see the
examples. Along these lines, I'm looking for more documentation projects
to work on. If you're in need of some solid technical writing, don't
hesitate to reach out. You can email me, or use...

--------------

*The Comments Section.* This is an idea I've had in my head for a while,
and I've finally decided to go for it. Over the past several months, my
site has been getting a lot more hits, so I figured now is a good time.
I'll include them selectively on pages where I think an audience might
find it useful or fun to comment, and reassess as I go. There's always
the possibility that they go empty for a while, and that's okay, too.

--------------

*Tea.* Unrelated to... anything else, I've decided to start a new
section/sub-focus for the site. My growing obsession over the past six
months or so has been Chinese tea, specifically puer and yancha. I
decided this week to just start posting some reviews/notes of the /many/
teas I've been trying and hopefully building that out into a section of
the site. This is all just for fun, and I'm certainly not a tea
expert--at the very least, though it will give me a way to archive my
thoughts on the teas I'm trying. I'm finishing two posts on Kuura Cola
and a 2018 Bulang raw puer tea from Liquid Proust that I'll publish
soon.

--------------

So, there are some updates. If any of this seems interesting to you, or
there are other things you'd like to see, try out that little comments

So, as I mentioned [[/posts/2024/04/some-updates/][in a recent post]],
I'm fully infected by the puer tea obsession. If you're unfamiliar, puer
is a type of fermented tea produced in the Yunnan region of China. It
comes in two major varieties, raw/sheng puer and ripe/shou puer. The
former is allowed to age naturally (and aging is *a thing* for puer)
while the latter goes through a process that was invented to
artificially "age" the tea "quicker." Really, though, this process
created a whole new variant that shares little resemblance to a raw puer
tea that has been aged. Whether raw or ripe, puer is typically pressed
into cakes for storage and distribution.

{{< figure src="cake.jpeg" alt="A photo of a tea cake in its packaging."
caption="A tea cake.">}}

I am not an expert on puer tea, by any means. I've been slowly /trying/
lots of teas and seeing what I like, but once you get into puer you feel
almost immediately how deep the rabbit hole is, and the fact that it is
a cross-cultural rabbit hole is especially humbling. What I'd like to
start doing, though, is posting some of my thoughts as I work through
various teas. So, consider this the first post in what I hope will be a
series of tea-oriented journal entries. My goal for these entries will
be more to learn (through writing) than to teach, but hopefully folks
will find something interesting in them.

Onto the tea at hand. I bought a few cakes of Kuura Cola without
sampling them, as the tea gets recommended quite a bit online as a
"daily drinker." I rarely drink coffee these days, and ripe puer has
become its substitute. Ripe puer is usually forgiving to brew
[[https://marshaln.com/whats-grandpa-style/]["grandpa style"]] in my
thermos and to take with me all day. Oddly, I've found Kuura Cola to
break that typical mold. It really benefits from gongfu-style brewing,
and I've had less success with grandpa style.

{{< figure src="cup.jpeg" alt="A photo of a a cup of Kuura Cola."
caption="Cola in my cup.">}}

Cola is a pretty standard ripe puer tea, which doesn't mean it isn't
good. It's got very sweet notes and very little ripe puer "funk."
Vanilla is the most dominant flavor to my pallate, and the soup is very
thick and dark. KuuraCorp's website claims that drinkers may pick up
sweet wood, as well, but I get less of that. This may have something to
do with White2Tea's Lumberslut being among my favorite teas, which is...
not subtle in terms of woody flavor profiles. Because of it's pleasant
sweetness, I could see Cola being a good introduction to puer. Moreover,
I think this would be a good tea if someone wanted to wean themselves
off of coffee, as this is a really hearty and full-bodied puer.

According to KuuraCorp, Cola is a blend of puer leaves, fermented in
2018/2019 and pressed in 2020. There isn't too much else in the way of
information, other than that Kuura typically sources from Xishuangbanna.
This lack of information is actually convenient for me, a new enthusiast
for a hobby that is /notorious/ for misinformation and spurious claims
to origin. The lack of specificity (and the very reasonable price) makes
things simple and easy.

Things were a bit less simple in learning how I liked to brew this tea,
though. KuuraCorp mentions giving the cake time to settle, and I
strongly agree. Truthfully, I hated the tea when I first sampled it. It
initially tasted very mineral-ish, which I don't dislike out of pocket
but which was overpowering to the point of almost tasting salty. Once I
gave the tea a few weeks to rest, though, the minerality faded and the
sweeter notes came forward.

The other surprising thing I learned, mentioned briefly above, is that
this tea /really/ shines when brewed gongfu, which is a practice of
using a high ratio of leaves to water and brewing leaves several times
using relatively short steeps. Many folks online are very... evangelist
about gongfu brewing, which makes sense because it is a wonderful method
to brew tea. That said, I am persuaded by those who note that gongfu
brewing is:

1. A relatively new phenomenon.
2. Not the way most people in the world drink tea.

While I certainly love brewing gongfu style and nearly always gongfu raw
and more expensive ripe puer, I just find myself drinking grandpa style
more often. This isn't only because of convenience, but also because
some teas just teas taste better to me when brewed grandpa style. Kuura
Cola is not one of those teas. I love it when brewed gongfu, but so far
the grandpa style brews end up reactivating the minerality that I
initially found off-putting.

All that said, I'm enjoying Kuura Cola. I've got a few sessions left of
the first cake and then am planning to let the second one sit for a
while and see what I think then.

This post details how I use
[[file:%5Blink%5D(https://textexpander.com/)][TextExpander]] to offer
high-quality feedback to my students in an organized and efficient
manner.

** Introduction

Teachers know the challenge of balancing time management and efficiency
against best practices for student learning, and this challenge is
compounded in writing-oriented courses. Many disciplines can assess
learning through exams, where feedback can be automated based on correct
and incorrect answers. Writing, however, is what the Ancient Greeks
called a /techne/.

Philosophers such as Aristotle used the term for activities that involve
learning-by-doing and where the creation of something new, rather than
passive knowledge, is the goal. Philosophers have debated whether
writing is, in fact, a techne throughout history.
[[https://parlorpress.com/products/techne-from-neoclassicism-to-postmodernism-understanding-writing-as-a-useful-teachable-art][Kelly
Pender's book /Techne, from Neoclassicism to Postmodernism/]] does a
fantastic job tracing these debates.

Putting the philosophy aside, though, it is obvious that students'
writing skills could never be assessed in something like a multiple
choice exam, nor could feedback be totally automated. Students learn
through individualized feedback on their writing.

But let's crunch a few numbers.

1. The student cap for a writing course is 25 students at my university.
   In a First-Year Writing course, there are nearly always at least 22
   students, but in my upper-level professional writing courses, there
   are often fewer. *So, let's put the average class size at 20
   students.*
2. *I teach four courses per semester.* This /is/ slightly higher than
   many teachers, but any university professor will tell you course
   loads like these are increasingly normal.
3. *Now, let's say I have an assignment that equates to roughly 8 pages
   of student writing.* This is a solid middle ground between my
   professional writing courses, which can be up to 20-page formal
   reports, not including appendices, and First-Year Writing courses
   where shorter papers are the norm.

Given these numbers, how many pages of student work need feedback *for
each assignment*?

*20 x 4 x 8 = 640.*

With workloads like this, teachers must strategically consider how
*aspects* of their workflows can be made more efficient to leave room
for what matters. In my workflow, this is where TextExpander comes in.

*TextExpander*

TextExpander is a tool that allows writers to save content for reuse in
related contexts. Think of it like your computer's clipboard on
steroids. Instead of pasting whatever text you last copied or cut, you
can paste /anything/ from a database that you create. To do this, you
add your content into TextExpander "snippet." Then, you can paste it
using a unique key command.

Let's start simple. TextExpander's stated goal is to save time. How much
time do you spend typing your email address while surfing the web? This
is a rhetorical question, but you can actually learn this: TextExpander
provides reports of how much time you save from using each snippet.

This is what the snippet for my email looks like in TextExpander.

{{< figure src="te-email.jpg" alt="A screenshot of a TextExpander
snippet." caption="The TextExpander snippet containing my email.">}}

And here is what happens when I use the keystrokes I've associated with
the snippets in another application.

{{< figure src="te-pem.gif" alt="A GIF demonstrating me typing a set of
keystrokes and TextExpander pasting my email" caption="This keystroke
abbreviation is zpem. TextExpander recommends starting each keystroke
abbreviation with an arbitrary character to prevent misfires. Note how
quickly and seamlessly TextExpander works.">}}

Pasting your email is simple, but you might already see some of the
possibilities for writing feedback. Here is a specific use case. In my
Professional Writing courses, students often revert to academic
formatting conventions that they are understandably familiar with but
that are inappropriate for professional documents like business letters,
reports, or memos. Noticing this, I found myself writing multiple
versions of the same comment across documents and decided to write a
snippet in TextExpander to automate that process.

{{< figure src="te-block.gif" alt="A screenshot of a TextExpander
snippet." caption="This snippet provides specific instructions on how to
format a business letter.">}}

This comment is essentially the same across students' papers, so turning
it into a reusable snippet saves me time to provide meaningful,
student-specific commentary on the things that matter.

While I won't cover every feature of TextExpander, it's worth noting
that the possibilities go far deeper than simple pasting. You can make
use of variables and can even employ keystrokes like "Return" to do
things like create entire document templates. I've even used
TextExpander to automate processes in Canvas (our learning management
system) that are less efficient than they could be. If you are creative,
the possibilities are staggering. You can essentially automate any use
of your computer keyboard.

*Benefits and Impact:*

Teachers may be wary about integrating a tool like TextExpander into
their workflow. To be clear, using snippets for *all* of your comments
would negatively affect feedback for students, who require unique and
specialized responses to learn.

But this concern seems silly from another perspective: *you don't have
to, and shouldn't, use TextExpander for everything*. I rarely use more
than three snippets in a single response, and they are all cases where I
would be rewriting the same comment across different documents. This
small use, though, saves me an incredible amount of time and mental
energy when responding to 640 pages of writing.

Additionally, writing snippets that can be used in different contexts is
a useful exercise. Writing reusable snippets helps you as a teacher
think about what information matters and how you can convey that
information usefully and succinctly. You begin to write these snippets
like a technical writer, thinking of them as content components. Again,
this gives you more time for meaningful, specific responses elsewhere.

*Tips for Using TextExpander in Your Writing Feedback:*

Here is a list of tips I wish I would have known when I started using
TextExpander.

1. *Organize Your Snippets, But Not Too Much.* Initially, I tried to
   organize my snippets into folders. First, I sorted them by class,
   then by area (Professional Writing, First-Year Writing, etc.). I soon
   realized that this created more difficulties than solutions, as it
   siloed comments from each other when I was reviewing my database. How
   you organize snippets is a personal decision, but don't make too many
   decisions in advance. This leads to my second tip.
2. *Review Your Database Regularly.* Schedule a time a time to review
   your database. Whether it's once a week or once a month, taking time
   to review snippets you've created is essential. You might notice that
   you accidentally created two snippets that say the same thing, or
   that one snippet would be more useful if broken into two. You might
   notice your organization system isn't serving you well. The review is
   essential for avoiding a cluttered mess.
3. *Be careful when including links.* It is tempting to include links in
   your snippets. I often do when pointing to citation instructions, for
   example. The only problem is that links change and expire. I
   recommend reviewing all snippets with links regularly to check that
   their referents remain correct. Having a dedicated folder for linked
   snippets might be useful here.

*Conclusion:*

As a writing professor, TextExpander has made my response workflow more
efficient. It helps me manage the workload of writing-intensive courses
by automating repetitive comments, giving me more time to focus on
individual student needs. While TextExpander does require a
subscription, it's been invaluable as a way to manage time.

knowledge work will need to embrace them and be conscious of both their
value and limitations. Ignoring them, though, is not a possibility.

This video provides strategies for effective communication. It
emphasizes the importance of storytelling for organizing information and
avoiding rambling. The three main tips discussed are:

1. *Ensuring a central point:* Think about your "one thing" when
   communicating, and branch out from there.
2. *A "3 Line Scene" Structure:* Start with "one thing," go deeper
   and/or add a surprise, and end with "what's next."
3. *Specificity:* Embrace /via negativa/ by considering what your point
   /isn't/, rather than all of the things it /is./ This can help with
   specificity. /"The success came not from ... but from ..."/

These tips help in delivering messages more efficiently and avoiding
unnecessary rambling.

Allington discusses the merits and drawbacks of using LaTeX, a document
markup language and typesetting system popular among scientists and
academics. The main arguments made are:

1. LaTeX is often promoted as a tool that allows writers to focus on
   content without worrying about formatting/design. However, the author
   argues this claim is misleading - writing in LaTeX's markup is
   distracting and disrupts the flow of writing prose.
2. Modern word processors allow structured writing and easy formatting
   changes without dealing with markup. The advantages claimed for LaTeX
   over word processors are either false or based on straw man
   comparisons.
3. LaTeX is useful for its high-quality typesetting capabilities,
   especially for technical documents with math equations. But it is not
   well-suited as a writing tool for prose.
4. For those wanting the typesetting benefits of LaTeX, the better
   approach is to write in a word processor or plain text editor, then
   convert to LaTeX for typesetting using conversion tools.
5. Installing and configuring the LaTeX system is notoriously difficult
   and user-unfriendly compared to word processors.

In summary, the essay debunks common claims that LaTeX is better for
writing and argues it should be used solely as a typesetting tool, not a
writing environment for prose.

This is one of my favorite articles I've stumbled across in quite a

- The history of LaTeX.
- A consideration of several
  "[[https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/][docs-as-code]]"
  approaches to academic writing and their different benefits and
  limitations. (The author doesn't use the term docs-as-code, but I'm
  unsure of another pithy term to refer to what he details.)
- A discussion of the separation of document design and content that
  challenges a lot of the conventional thinking you'll see if you pay
  attention to the various docs-as-code communities online. (For a great
  discussion of presentation vs. content, see Clark (2007).

If you're interested in the technical side of writing and documentation,
the history of writing media, or academic writing, there is so much to
chew on in this article. It gave me a lot of ideas about my own writing
workflows, and I don't even use LaTeX. I highly recommend the article.

This post contains spoilers for Steven Peck's novella, /A Short Stay in
Hell./

{{< /warning >}}

A few months ago, I read /A Short Stay in Hell/ by Steven Peck. In the
novella, a Mormon, not having followed the one true religion of
Zoroastrianism, finds himself in Hell. His damnation isn't the typical
sort, however. What's atypical about this Hell is the possibility of
working one's way out. Rather than being subjected to the usual forms of
punishment, the damned are given a task to earn their exit.

Hell, it turns out, is an impossibly vast library, and those sent there
have to find a book that perfectly captures their life story. Each book
in the library is the same length and contains every possible
permutation of letters and punctuation, regardless of language or even
coherence. There is a book that is entirely comprised by the letter A,
one that is the comprised by all A's and only a single B, and so on.

The damned are given anything they would like to eat or drink, remain in
perfect health, are free to form relationships, and are given beds and
sheets. They can "die" but are simply respawned the next morning if they
do. They have infinite time to search the library, which is made up of
an unfathomable number of floors. Nothing compels them to search,
however, and thousands of years go by at times where the narrator is
simply doing other things.

What the novella plays with is that, on paper, Hell doesn't seem so bad.
There is no fire, no painful punishment at the hands of demons. But what
the reader sees in the story has less to do with the classical terror of
fire and brimstone and more to do with the existential horror of
possibility. The devastating quality is that everyone knows that Hell
/isn't/ infinite. Strangely, infinity is easier to conceive than the
fact that out of all possible combinations of letters there is a book
that describes your life and that you cannot leave until you find it.

Like Sartre's /No Exit,/ the horror also comes from other people. When a
cult forms and decides their "Godly" purpose is to inflict as much pain
as possible on others, the existential dread becomes more visceral.
Given that no one can permanently die but everyone still feels pain,
there are scenes in which people become captured by the cultists and are
simply tortured to death each day for thousands of years.

At one point, the narrator falls in love. This relationship goes on so
long that, at one point, the narrator mentions that they got bored and
just pretended they were animals for a few hundred years. When the
cultists eventually attempt to seize them, his love jumps over the
railing of the library (each floor is a perfect square with an
impossibly deep drop in the center), and the narrator never sees her
again.

There's an old /Twilight Zone/ episode that's hard not to think about
when reading /A Short Stay in Hell./ Truthfully, I don't remember the
finer points, but the major plot is this: a booklover is "imprisoned" in
a library where he will have to spend all of his time reading ("Yes!")
but he immediately breaks his glasses ("No!"). The stories have obvious
parallels but considering their differences points something out about
Peck's novella. In the /Twilight Zone/, the major disaster is /not/
being able to access the incredible amount of text that is contained in
a library when given infinite free time. In /A Short Stay in Hell/, the
horror is having that infinite free time and infinite text.

People often associate text and writing with meaning. But what is
fascinating about /A Short Stay in Hell/ is that the narrator is the
least happy and the least present when he is actively searching for his
life story. During the eras where he gives up his personal and
ultimately selfish attachment to finding his story, he has his happiest
moments. There is something interesting there.

Artificial intelligence (AI) significantly impacts the environment
beyond its carbon dioxide emissions from training and running systems,
as its diverse applications often have greater effects. Experts like
Jesse Dodge and David Rolnick emphasize that AI's primary environmental
impact comes from its usage, which can either harm or help the
environment. For instance, AI can increase fossil fuel production,
exacerbating emissions, but it also aids in disaster response and
emissions monitoring through tools like xView2 and Climate TRACE.
Effective climate action requires addressing AI's emissions and
applications, with ethical guidelines and policies to minimize harm and
maximize benefits.

The Slideworks.io article on writing action titles like McKinsey
explains the importance of action titles in PowerPoint presentations. An
action title conveys the main takeaway of a slide in a concise, active
sentence, improving clarity, cohesiveness, and impact. The article
provides steps and best practices for crafting effective action titles,
such as being specific, concise, and using an active voice. These titles
help to structure the presentation's storyline and ensure that each
slide's message is clear and compelling.

I typically teach slide design using Edward Tufte's principles for
information-rich visual content. I came across this link, and I'm
honestly not entirely sure how I feel about its recommendations. While
it has merit in terms of foregrounding clarity and concision, at times I
feel like this falls more in line with some of the things that Tufte,
for example, would see as non-essential visual information. In any case,
I did find it useful and may use it as a counterpoint example for
business and technical writing students.

Here are a few interesting reads for the week. The first is my own
write-up on Steven Peck's excellent horror novella /A Short Stay in
Hell/. The other two deal with my more typical subject matter, focusing
on storytelling for UX design and document version control.

As always, I generate summaries using AI and edit those summaries for

This analysis of Steven Peck's /A Short Stay in Hell/ explores its
unique depiction of Hell as a vast library where souls must find a book
that perfectly describes their life to escape. Unlike traditional
portrayals of Hell, this one emphasizes the existential horror of
endless possibilities and the psychological torment of a seemingly
achievable yet elusive goal. The novella contrasts the despair of
searching for meaning with the fleeting happiness of abandoning the
quest. Wysocki notes parallels to Sartre's /No Exit/ and a /Twilight
Zone/ episode.

It seems silly to offer more thoughts, given that the post is full of
them. I can at least add a brief postscript.

There is more to the novella than the horror. Read through the lens of
Zen/mindfulness, /A Short Stay in Hell/ gives insight into where our
attention should rest to achieve happiness and on our obligations to
others. How much of this was Peck's intention? I'm not sure. But, as we
in the humanities assert (sometimes too strongly and frequently
inconsistently),

The article highlights the importance of storytelling in UX design,
emphasizing its role in creating engaging and meaningful user
experiences by conveying the purpose and value of a product, evoking
empathy, and guiding users through their journey. It explains how
stories help designers empathize with users, present design ideas more
effectively, and make research insights more relatable. The *Story
Spine* structure, popularized by Pixar and Disney, is recommended for
organizing narratives, comprising stages like setting context,
introducing a twist, and resolving the story. Examples illustrate how
this structure can be applied in UX presentations, showing its
effectiveness in connecting deeply with users and enhancing the impact
of design work.

This article picks up a theme present in the links I shared from
[[/posts/2024/06/link-roundup-june-17-2024/][Vicky Zhao/Ian Daniel
Stewart a few weeks ago]]: the importance of *storytelling*. As a
writer, storytelling is, of course, near and dear to me. As a teacher,
it is something that I try to instill in each of my students, whether
they are professional/technical writers or students in a First-Year
Writing course.

This article's value lies in how it argues for storytelling in UX
design. Moreover, it offers lots of clear examples of how one
storytelling structure (The Story Spine) can be used in design contexts.

The author provides a few answers to why stories matter in UX design. I
can't help noting how they nearly exactly map onto rhetorical concepts.
Why Stories?

- To understand and empathize with users. (Research.)
- To present design ideas. ([[/tags/genre/][Genre]], invention, and
  delivery.)
- To share insights in a memorable format. (Circulation and mnemonics.)

Document version control is crucial in technical writing to manage
different document versions, ensuring consistency and preventing errors.
It involves naming conventions, centralized collaboration, and tracking
changes. Best practices include standardized file naming, version
suffixes, and synchronized work on a single document to avoid confusion
and improve efficiency. Implementing version control enhances team
communication, prevents accidental overwriting, and maintains compliance
with industry standards, ultimately saving time and resources. Automated
tools further streamline this process by creating and managing versions
efficiently.

This is a great article on the importance of version control for
technical writing and, honestly, for writers in general. It provides a
succinct definition of version control ("tracking and managing different
versions of a document to ensure users can identify the current
version") and doesn't assume high-tech solutions like Git. This
simplicity makes the argument persuasive for multiple audiences,
regardless of technical knowledge. I could see this being a valuable
resource for teaching or even for persuading co-workers to adopt a
version control protocol.

:END:

This post discusses a meta-analysis of studies related to trust in AI
systems published by Alexandra D. Kaplan, Theresa T. Kessler, J.
Christopher Brill, and P. A. Hancock in
[[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00187208211013988][/Human
Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society/.]] As
I review it, I consider its implications for how AI might continue to be
taken up in work contexts.

One of the things you notice in conversations about AI is how extreme
the question of trust can be. Some folks immediately discredit using AI,
while others accept it uncritically. Binary thinking is easy when any
new technology pops up, but given AI's radical potential to transform
activity it feels understandable, if somewhat misguided.

Personally, my perspective on AI tools is neither wholly positive nor
negative. I tend to start from the assumption that they are "are here,"
that it's better to understand them, their affordances, and their
limitations than to ignore them. Kaplan et al.'s meta-analysis is useful
in that effort.

** Article Methodology and Overview
   :PROPERTIES:

   :ID:       C2835171-0F7B-44E6-AD1A-AAD7B85B785B
   :END:
Kaplan et al. analyzed 65 articles in their meta-analysis. Specifically,
they included articles that addressed:

- Relationships between the human trustor, the AI trustee, and their
  shared context.
- Human characteristics and abilities.
- AI performance and attributes.
- Contextual multitasking.

Studies that met the following criteria were included:

- Studies that were peer-reviewed.
- Studies where trust in AI was a dependent variable.
- Studies with enough statistical data to determine effect size.
- Studies that did not include vulnerable populations.
- English-based studies.

Across the 65 articles, Kaplan et al. noted four common "delivery
systems" for AI:

- Chatbots.
- Robots.
- Automated vehicles.
- Non-embodied AI/algorithms.

While the authors noted several limitations in their meta-analysis,
their findings pose interesting considerations and questions about trust
in AI systems.

** Trust in AI
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: trust-in-ai
   :ID:       06A2CE0F-2056-419E-91D5-82782EB3D5D8
   :END:
So, what factors affect an individual's trust in AI? Kaplan et al.
highlighted several fascinating responses to that question. It's useful
to point out, though, that the authors didn't engage the question of
whether we *should* trust AI systems. This is understandable for many
reasons, including the nature of their study and the difficulty of
assessing AI /in general/. Personally, I think it's going to be
increasingly less useful to talk about AI as "a thing." To ask whether
we should trust AI, in my view, will soon be like asking whether we
should trust websites. /“Well... It depends/ /on the site and how you
are using it, obviously.”/

That said, I am going to take the authors' lead and offer less of my own
thoughts on the trustworthiness of specific technologies. It seems more
interesting to think through and play out what their findings tell us
about how and why individuals trust/distrust AI systems.

*** Human Factors Related to Trust in AI
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: human-factors-related-to-trust-in-ai
    :ID:       C871163A-C753-4338-BBFB-F0AC5DF1F761
    :END:
Across the surveyed studies, the authors noted several human factors
that were predictors of trust in AI systems. Personality, culture, and
identity factors were found relevant. A few examples:

1. "Lonely participants" in studies were found less likely to trust AI
   while "innovative individuals" were more likely to pursue its use.
2. A variety of cultural factors and identities were found to affect
   trust. For example, Germans were more trusting, whereas Japanese
   individuals tended toward skepticism.
3. Male participants were generally more willing to trust AI than female
   participants (343).

While specific findings may be individually more or less surprising, it
seems fairly evident that human factors would play into trust in AI.

One of their findings, though, was more compelling to me because it was
something I hadn't considered. Kaplan et al. noted that an individual
user's technical competency and understanding of an AI system are seen
to be positive predictors of trust. Additionally, a user's expertise in
their tasks---what they are trying to *do* with AI---also factored
positively (343). *What this suggests, to me, is that a large part of
achieving trust in AI systems is increasing knowledge of how they
function and fostering environments where goals can be met through their
use.*

Many technical folks know the anxious feeling of trying to set up a
friend or family member with a "cool new tech" and have it not work
immediately. (If it's not obvious, I'm talking about myself here.) The
anxiety comes from knowing that while the fix may take seconds, trust in
the system is diminished and might not recover. In terms of AI, it seems
like the same phenomenon is at play. *If one's goal is to increase trust
in an AI system (which, again, I'm not saying should be true in every
situation), then creating small-scale positive outcomes seems more
important than riskier attempts at paradigm shifts.*

*** Technological Factors Related to Trust in AI
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: technological-factors-related-to-trust-in-ai
    :ID:       C485846F-4243-456A-BB5F-DBF864B7BDF1
    :END:
Across the 65 articles, there were also many findings about how AI
systems, as technology, factored into user trust. The reliability and
performance of an AI system were highly predictive of trust (344). More
than that, though, the /visibility/ of possible failure or negative
outcomes is correlated to trust, as well. Because of the possibility for
AI systems to "exhibit undesirable behavior," humans need "properly
calibrated trust in AI systems [that] highlight the potential for
negative outcomes" (347).

This visibility may be increasingly difficult as AI systems continue to
develop, though. The authors warned that AI may continue to develop as
black boxes to users. While this has clear issues related to human
agency, a corollary concern is that it will decrease trust in AI
systems.

#+begin_quote
  While current iterations of AI do not have an internal drive to
  misbehave, lack of transparency in some systems may seem to indicate
  deception to some users. Self-repairing code and learning systems that
  generate new code based upon experience do not require a user's input.
  Systems will, therefore, become increasingly 'black boxes,' leaving
  the human beyond the loop on decisions and may subsequently then be
  (mis)interpreted as devious or deceptive. (347)
#+end_quote

*Trust doesn't just depend on success, but an understanding of possible
points of failure/limitations. But this understanding may be made
difficult by technological development.*

*** Trust in Context

    :ID:       8CB9B6B2-0D29-4B0A-9BD9-992809AC42D7
    :END:
Finally, the authors discussed contextual factors related to trust in
AI. For example, the "personality" of an AI system was relevant to the
amount of trust it provoked. People preferred AI systems that encouraged
collaboration but, maybe obviously, distrusted ones where they perceived
elements of deception (344). They also preferred voice-based
communication over text (344-45).

The reputation of the AI system was also found to drive trust (344).
This finding calls up the question of marketing of AI systems and how
that might transform their uptake. What feels so significant about
[[https://openai.com/index/openai-and-apple-announce-partnership/][Apple's
partnership with OpenAI]] is that it gives the latter company access to
Apple's fairly stellar reputation. *For better or worse, the marketing
of "Apple Intelligence" (see the video below) feels much more...
reassuring than OpenAI. I sense that this will lead to more widespread
adoption of and trust in AI tools.*

   :END:
I've highlighted what I see as the main implications of Kaplan et al.'s
findings above, but here is a quick review.

- Trust is increased by functional knowledge of an AI system.
- If one's goal is to increase trust in an AI system, then creating
  small-scale positive outcomes seems more important than paradigm
  shifts.
- Helping users understand points of failure/limitations of AI is
  central to developing trust. But this understanding may be made
  difficult as they continue to be "black-boxed."
- As with all technologies, marketing and brand recognition will play a
  central role in increasing trust and adoption.

Again, I'm purposely avoiding whether we *should* trust a given AI
system because that question is simply too large to answer in general.
But, to the degree that AI tools will be accepted and reshape labor,
it's worth being aware of the reasons that individuals trust them, or
not. I definitely recommend Kaplan et al.'s meta-analysis for more
detail on the topic.

His emphasis on defamiliarization, noticing, and asking questions are
qualities I try to cultivate daily, and the way he applies those general

itself, is defamiliarizing and valuable. As with pretty much everything

Wayne explores the concept of friction in software development, drawing
an analogy to military friction as defined by

such as changing APIs, bugs, unclear requirements, and tool failures. He
suggests strategies to mitigate friction, including smaller scopes, more
autonomy, redundancy, better planning, automation, and gaining
experience through gaming and checklists. Wayne emphasizes that while
friction is inevitable, effective management can reduce its impact.

I saw this posted on [[https://news.ycombinator.com/][Hacker News]] and
found it thought-provoking. I think the definition of friction Wayne
develops from Clausewitz---the delta between our theoretical experience
and our actual experience---is interesting and applies to a host of
topics. We see friction in our relationships, our lifepaths, our uptake
of new tools, and---as Wayne points out primarily---in software
development. Wayne also poses a lot of interesting questions about
friction toward the end of his article, a move that connects nicely to
Tom Johnson's post above.

The Atlantic hurricane season, starting June 1, usually sees significant
activity in August or September. This year, however, unusually warm sea
temperatures have led to the rapid intensification of Hurricane Beryl,
which became a Category 5 storm with 165 mph winds on July 1. This is
the earliest such storm on record. Beryl's unprecedented development
early in the season is alarming and may signal a hyperactive hurricane
season, influenced by climate change and La Niña. Although Beryl is
expected to weaken, it remains a major concern for Jamaica and Mexico's
Yucatan peninsula. This early and intense activity highlights the
increasing severity of hurricanes due to warmer seas.

  The emerging consensus from scientists has been that there will be a 1

Ferri Bendetti argues that to set a technical writer up for success,
ensure they have adequate access to information, a robust documentation
toolchain, and integrate them into the development process. Encourage a
documentation-first approach, involve them in AI development, and help
them break down content silos. Providing these resources and fostering
collaboration will enable your technical writer to significantly enhance
product usability and communication.

This article, published in the Harvard Business Review, emphasizes the
importance of self-awareness and self-management in achieving success.
Drucker argues that individuals must understand their strengths, how
they perform best, their values, and where they can make the greatest
contribution. By taking responsibility for their own development and
managing their relationships effectively, individuals can navigate their
careers more successfully. He also stresses the importance of knowing
when to change course and the need for continuous learning and
self-improvement.

This article is a bit older, but I hadn't read it before. Given my
background in philosophy, I don't throw the word "wisdom" around
loosely. That said, though, this article comes extremely close.
Drucker's thoughts on self-management go well beyond the "business
self-help" genre and offer life advice that can apply to seemingly any
human activity. There's too much to touch on in one link roundup, but
I'll highlight Drucker's heuristic for activities that make a
difference---difficult, meaningful, and measurable---as especially
useful. I can see this heuristic, alone, as a start to a goal-setting
session at multiple levels, regardless of whether those goals are
counted in weeks or years and whether they are personal or
organizational.

The article is a reflection on the legacy of psychologist Lee Ross,
focusing on his concept of the "fundamental attribution error." This
idea highlights the human tendency to attribute others' behaviors to
their character rather than their circumstances. The article explains
that while initially considered a simple concept, it evolved into a more
nuanced understanding that varies depending on one's relationships and
biases. The fundamental attribution error has significant implications
for interpersonal and international relations, often reinforcing
tribalism and conflict. The author emphasizes the importance of
cognitive empathy--understanding others' perspectives--as a tool for
resolving conflicts and solving global problems. Ross's insights suggest
that awareness and cultivation of cognitive empathy can mitigate the
harmful effects of attribution error, contributing to a more
understanding and cooperative world.

While I don't agree with Robert Wright on everything, I always find his
ideas interesting and offered in good faith. This article is great and
provides an excellent heuristic for increasing one's capacity for a good
faith engagement with others and with the world. The trickiness of how
we associate a person's actions with their character rather than with
their situation (attribution error) mainly when we dislike them is
obvious when brought into consciousness but still requires practice to
overcome. Just to promote Wright a bit further, his book
[[https://www.amazon.com/Why-Buddhism-True-Philosophy-Enlightenment/dp/1439195455][/Why

especially for those primarily interested in secular Buddhism. (I would
be remiss not to note that secular Buddhism is a contested and sometimes
controversial term/field.)

South Korea's Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs has
designated five individuals as Korean Food Grand Masters for their
excellence in kimchi making. These masters, including a former pop
singer and a YouTuber, emphasize the importance of using high-quality
ingredients and traditional methods. They express concerns about the
rise of mass-produced kimchi, stressing that authentic kimchi requires
patience and dedication. Each master has a unique approach and recipe,
such as seafood kimchi, white kimchi, and stuffed white kimchi,
reflecting their personal histories and the cultural significance of
this traditional Korean dish.

I'm fairly certain I haven't written about my love of making kimchi, but
I am very passionate about the Korean art of fermented
cabbage/vegetables/seafood/everything else. I often get asked if I've
spent time in South Korea, have a particular family connection, or if
there is some other reason for my love of making kimchi. The answer to
all those is no. (I have spent time learning the Korean language, though
am still very much a beginner). I just loved all of the delicious
kimchis I had access to when I lived in Southern California. Living in
Indiana, I'm sad to say, offers no such access.

{{< figure src="kimchi.jpeg" alt="A photo of my kimchi." caption="I'm

In any case, the comments from these South Korean kimchi masters will
ring true to anyone who has deep-dived into kimchi blogs and books and
pored over the ingredients in a Korean market with their phone out to
translate the labels. While I would never put myself on the same level
as with these kimchi masters (or an 아줌마, for that matter), it is very
clear that kimchi is an activity that awards precision and patience.

This is, admittedly, not so much an article as an update from Google.
That said, I am *so excited* by this update. I don't use Google
Drive/Docs much, aside from keeping my weight-lifting spreadsheets to
reference them easily at the gym. (Now that I have a gym in my garage,
that seems less necessary...) The *only* writing tools I enjoy using are
Microsoft Word (writing a doctoral dissertation in the humanities will
do that to you) and Markdown. I use many other tools in my writing
workflow (Pandoc is *major*) but if we're talking about the /writing
itself/, it's .docx or .md for me.

{{< figure src="wayne.jpg" alt="A photo of Wayne from the TV show

And yet, it feels like everyone else uses Google Docs. This is
understandable and there are lots of good reasons why people love it. I
have my own bones to pick with Docs, which maybe I'll write about
someday, but it's undeniably useful for many.

And that's why this update feels so amazing! It's going to offer a
really easy way to integrate non-Markdown writers into Markdown
workflows. Finally, I'll be able to make the argument to folks I work
with that we can use integrate interesting and useful Markdown-based
tools and workflows (like [[/tags/hugo][Hugo]]) without writers having
to change much, if anything, about their writing process. That's the
dream, anyway. :smiley:

This article argues that biology, chemistry, and physics are emergent
properties arising from simpler rules and interactions. The concept of
emergence is illustrated using the "Game of Life," a cellular automaton
with four simple rules that produce complex and lifelike patterns from
simple initial conditions. The article extends this idea to real-world
systems and connects it to AI, specifically large language models like
GPT-3, which exhibit emergent properties by producing coherent text and
solving problems beyond their initial training. The future of AI is seen
as being shaped by emergent principles observed in nature. The author
reflects on human actions as emergent, pondering the origins and
triggers of thoughts and behaviors.

While this is a short article, it touches on a concept that I find
extremely important at a personal level: complexity as an emergent
property.
[[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07350198.2020.1727101][My
early academic research]] focused on the emergent complexity of
documentation and archives. I used the at-that-time-fashionable
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_materialism]["new materialism"]] as
a way of considering the emergent properties involved in creating an
archive and, in that way, guiding history. (I don't mean any disrespect
to new materialism, but it does seem to be a mode of thinking
that---like many "hot" intellectual topics---suffered from success.) In
any case, this author does a nice job explaining some of the basic ideas
related to emergent complexity in an accessible manner. I agree that it
is worth seriously considering the emergent nature of AI.

So, this article may be "a lot" for non-musicians. What it's
highlighting, though, is that music---all of it---relies on a fairly
simple set of rules from which complexity (such as tritone substitution)
emerges. In that regard, music is perhaps /the best/ example of what the
article above discussed. From rhythms to melodies, there are simple
systems that exist that, when experimented with appropriately, generate
the complexity of what we hear as music. The tritone substitution (a
fascinating bit of music theory) demonstrates just that sort of
experimentation.

The article discusses how journalists are increasingly taking control of
archiving their work due to concerns over the longevity and
accessibility of their content. With traditional news archives often at
risk due to financial instability, ownership changes, or technology
issues, journalists are turning to personal efforts and digital tools to
preserve their reporting. These efforts ensure that their work, which
serves as historical records, remains accessible to the public and
future generations, even if media organizations fail to maintain their
archives.

The creation of [[/tags/archival-research][archives]] was one of the two
primary areas of focus in my doctoral work. The other one was
([[/posts/2021/11/what-is-new-about-new-media/][so-called "new"]]) media
theory, so it should be clear that this article speaks to my interests.
The seeming daily occurrence of news sites going dark and its
intersection with the lack of archival efforts was something I hadn't
considered but seems particularly salient after reading the article.

As I've discussed in [[/posts/2021/11/memory-document-archive/][another
post]], there have been significant shifts in how archives are seen
across disciplines. Whereas archives used to be considered passive,
objective containers of the past, they are often seen today as active
sites where memory is /made/, not simply reflected. And as this article
demonstrates, the way that LLMs are trained on available, existing
resources only further complicates archival work.

What happens, the article asks, when a news article is brought into an
LLM but is then deleted from the web, leaving only its trace in the
"knowledge" of an AI system? It's a fascinating question. In regards to
that and many other questions, archival science and related humanities
fields are well-suited to offer insights into and warnings about
knowledge-making in the post-AI landscape.

The article advocates for "outline speed-running" as a method to rapidly
build projects by creating detailed, recursive outlines and then quickly
filling them in without worrying about perfection. This approach
contrasts with the slower "loading-bar" method, where tasks are
completed sequentially and refined as you go. By focusing on speed and
deferring perfection to the end, this method can lead to a significant
increase in productivity and quality, reducing stress and improving
outcomes.

It's becoming unintentionally common for me to include shorter articles
that touch on productivity and writing in these link roundups. In part,
that's because I read [[https://news.ycombinator.com/][Hacker News]]
regularly, where these conversations are common. It's also the case that
I'm just attracted to these sorts of ideas... in complicated ways. On
one hand, the field of Writing Studies tends to agree that writing is
best understood and taught as a series of processes rather than using
product-based models such as the now-outdated
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theories_of_rhetoric_and_composition_pedagogy#Current-traditional_rhetoric][Current-Traditional
Rhetoric]]. In that regard, this article's focus on process is
interesting and insightful.

At the same time, though, I sometimes worry that too much focus on
process creates a different misunderstanding, where writing is put into
the terms of "optimization." I have a post in the works about this, but
it's enough to say here that process optimization feels fundamentally at
odds with writing-as-thinking and, sometimes, with actually getting
things done at all. More to come on this topic later in the week.

That said, I do like this article. The idea of "loading-bar writing"
(writing from the beginning of a document to its end) is a useful
metaphor and one I'll likely share with my students this semester. I
agree with the author that it is often (if not always) a poor and
inefficient writing practice. Additionally, I think the idea of
recursive outlining is useful, and the author's discussion of it aligns
with
[[/posts/2023/07/ted-nelsons-evolutionary-list-file-and-information-management/][interesting
historical conversations about media and thinking processes]].
Regardless of my hang-ups, the article is short and worth a read.

Graham advises startups to engage in non-scalable tasks, especially in
their early stages, to build a strong foundation. He emphasizes the
importance of hands-on approaches like personal customer interactions,
manual user acquisition, and crafting tailored solutions. These efforts,
though not scalable, are crucial for understanding customer needs,
building a loyal user base, and gaining valuable insights that can guide
scalable growth later on. The key message is that scaling prematurely
can be detrimental to long-term success.

I hadn't read this article before, but I saw it cited elsewhere as a
foundational piece of advice for startups and decided to check it out.
As with several things lately, it fits right in with my developing
critique of the optimization mindset. At a certain point, ideas about
optimizing can overtake that actual work of /effort./ Graham makes that
point in a number of ways related to startups, but the broad takeaway is
that it's often the things that /don't/ immediately yield or even center

The article discusses the vulnerability of Europe's electricity grid due
to centralized, cloud-based management of millions of solar panels.
These systems, largely unregulated, could be hacked or malfunction,
leading to massive power disruptions. The author calls for stricter
regulation, treating these management platforms like energy companies
rather than just websites. Upcoming EU directives like NIS2 and the
Cyber Resilience Act could help address these issues, but immediate
action is needed to prevent potential grid failures.

[[https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262529969/a-prehistory-of-the-cloud/][Tung-Hui
Hu's /A Prehistory of the Cloud/]], which has a lot of parallel lines to
Hubert's article here. The article is centrally focused on the
Netherlands but (as Hubert notes) its themes and the problems it
identifies are certainly internationally concerning. In his
/Prehistory,/ Hu writes:

  as each infrastructure becomes naturalized, we tend to refer to it

   :ID:       AA351192-5491-4DC3-840A-503403FBBDBE
   :END:
I want to start this post with three definitions from the Oxford
Dictionary. They're related, but I want to show you that they are very
different in practice.

- *Optimal*: Best, most favourable, esp. under a particular set of
  circumstances.
- *Optimize*: To render optimal, to make as good as possible; to make
  the best or most effective use of.
- *Optimization*: The action or process of making the best of something;
  (also) the action or process of rendering optimal; the state or
  condition of being optimal.

I'm a writer and professor, so you'll need to indulge me in this next
part. Look at the part of speech each word occupies.

- *Optimal is a noun.* It simply *is* the favorable condition and it
  exists (as the definition indicates) in a specific context.
- *Optimize is a verb.* It is a *process*. Like all verbs and processes,
  in English at least, it is implied that it can take place and still
  fail to meet necessary conditions. We can write... and fail to meet
  our word count. We can give a speech... and fail to persuade our
  audience. And we can optimize... and fail to do anything, really, at
  all.
- *Optimization is a nominalization.* A nominalization occurs when we
  turn a verb into a noun. Notice that nominalizing "optimize" doesn't
  just return us to "optimal," the noun that the verb "optimize"
  ostensibly guides us toward. What this suggests, I want to argue, is
  that optimal and optimization, while similar at first glance, point to
  very different things and, often, are at odds.

   :END:
Nominalization is well known among writers as, at least, a potentially
problematic tendency. In technical writing, nominalizations are known to
be, well, annoying and confusing.
[[https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/words/avoid-hidden-verbs/#:~:text=What%20are%20hidden%20verbs%3F][PlainLanguage.gov]]
offers several examples, but here's one:

- Nominalization: If you cannot *make the payment* of the $100 fee, you
  must *make an application* in writing before you file your tax return.
- Corrected: If you cannot *pay* the $100 fee, you must *apply* in
  writing before you file your tax return.

It's clear when you look at the examples side by side. Keeping "pay" and
"apply" as verbs simplifies things and ensures the sentence is clear and
direct.

Okay, this first example may seem like a small deal to non-technical
writers. (It's not, by the way.) But there are other reasons to be
skeptical of nominalizations.
[[https://archive.nytimes.com/opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/the-dark-side-of-verbs-as-nouns/][Henry
Hitchings writes]] that while nominalizations aren't bad by nature, they
can certainly serve unethical purposes:

#+begin_quote
  Nominalizations give priority to actions rather than to the people
  responsible for them. Sometimes this is apt, perhaps because we don't
  know who is responsible or because responsibility isn't relevant. But
  often they conceal power relationships and reduce our sense of what's
  truly involved in a transaction. As such, they are an instrument of
  manipulation, in politics and in business. They emphasize products and
  results, rather than the processes by which products and results are
  achieved.
#+end_quote

Hitchings is pointing out an insight familiar to rhetoricians: passive
language conceals the subject and context of the action.

   :END:
Here is one last piece of context before getting to my main point. While
thinking about this post, I grew curious about the use of optimal,
optimize, and optimization over time. My curiosity led me to plug the
terms into the [[https://books.google.com/ngrams/][Google Books Ngram
Viewer]], which tracks the frequency of search terms in printed sources
published between 1500 and 2019 within a particular set of languages.
What I found speaks (metaphorically) to the claim I want to present.

{{< figure src="n-gram.jpg" link="n-gram.jpg" caption="Optimal,
optimize, and optimization over time. (Click to enlarge.)" alt="A Google
NGram line-chart showing that the use of optimize and optimization grow
while the term optimal declines, beginning slight after the year 2000."
>}}

Note how, beginning around the Internet era, the use of "optimal"
declined while "optimize" and "optimization" increased. There are plenty
of possible explanations for this, the most obvious one being benign
changes in language patterns. This is why I want to stress that I'm
making a metaphorical association here, not a causal or a scientific
one.

Still, though, the Ngram does speak to my larger point: the *actual
condition* of being optimal doesn't necessarily correlate to the action
of optimizing nor to pursuing optimizations. In fact, these words
highlight conflicting goals.

** Optimization Eats Goals

   :ID:       80214863-D9E5-49AB-BFF2-10A4E8C1F615
   :END:
When we pursue goals, we often take any optimization as an assumed good.
That's understandable to a degree. We all have limited time and
resources to pursue our aims. But my experience is that a focus on
optimization is nearly never helpful. Sometimes, the /optimization
state/--the mindset where we focus on optimizing the process rather than
pursuing the goal---clouds our ability to *even get started.* If you
start thinking about this, examples from all areas of life are readily
available:

- /The optimization state:/ I need to figure out the optimal fitness
  plan before beginning to work out. /The result/: Not getting started.
- /The optimization state:/ I need to draft the optimal outline or take
  the optimal notes before I can write a word on the page. /The result/:
  Not getting started.
- /The optimization state:/ I need to research the optimal workflow for
  collecting research articles before I begin to read. /The result:/ Not
  getting started.
- /The optimization state:/ I need to decide on the optimal breathwork
  technique before beginning a mindfulness practice. /The result:/ Not
  getting started.

But there are other ways that the pursuit of optimization can hinder our
goals beyond just deferring our ability to get started. Often, pursuing
optimization simply runs us in circles.

** Optimization Means "Getting off the Bus"
   :PROPERTIES:

   :END:
In /4000 Weeks: Time Management for Mortals/, Oliver Burkeman discusses
the concept of "staying on the bus" as a metaphor for a subtle way we
undercut ourselves in the pursuit of our goals. Here is the metaphor.
You decide you want to go somewhere. This "somewhere" is your unique
goal, what you want to accomplish. You decide to take a bus to your
"somewhere." Eventually, you begin questioning your choice: was this the
right bus to take? Will this take me somewhere I want to go? Finally,
you cave and get off at the next stop. You walk back to where you
started and try taking another bus. Most likely, you then have the same
worry and repeat the same process. You waste time over and over when, if
you had simply stayed on the bus, you might have made it "somewhere."

Burkeman uses this metaphor to point out that we often "get off the bus"
when our creative work is unoriginal. Instead, he argues, we become
original by "staying on the bus" until our unoriginal work transforms
into something unique. But this metaphor applies to *so many other
endeavors*. Just take the list above:

- I decide that the fitness plan I have been following isn't moving me
  toward the results I want quickly enough. I see another plan I could
  follow, an *optimization*. I quit what I'm doing to start an entirely
  different plan at the beginning. /I've gotten off the bus./
- I decide that there is an *optimization* I could apply to my notes or
  outlines that could be made after I read about another method online.
  I spend a month reformatting all my notes rather than
  writing/studying. /I've gotten off the bus./
- A cool, new citation manager affords *optimizations* for collecting my
  research. I spend a month moving my library and, most likely, paying a
  new subscription fee rather than reading. /I've gotten off the bus./
- I spend four years meditating by counting my breath but see an online
  figure cite mantra work as an *optimization* for practice. I restart
  my practice. /I've gotten off the bus./

In each of these scenarios, I hope it's becoming clear that worrying
about optimization is... pretty non-optimal. It's forcing us off the
bus, to continue to restart our efforts and feel "productive" when, in
actuality, optimization alone never gets us anywhere.

   :END:
To pull these threads together, the optimization state messes up the
context of our activity in the same way as nominalizations more
generally. While there are certainly times to
[[https://learnhowtolearn.org/how-to-build-extremely-quickly/][reconsider
fundamental assumptions and to alter our workflows]], for many this can
become a habit of distraction with the /appearance/ of being productive.
Rather than progressing toward the condition that "optimal" describes,
we get caught in the feedback loop of the optimization state. *We start
to see optimization, itself, as the goal.*

Hitchings pointed out above that nominalizations can be a tool of
manipulation. Likewise, we manipulate ourselves when we obsessively look
for "optimizations" for our workflows. This tendency too often stands in
place of optimal. Stay on the bus.

The article explores Alan Kay's provocative idea that "data" might be a
fundamentally flawed concept. It discusses the ethical and political
implications of data, particularly how it objectifies people and
consolidates power in large organizations. The author suggests that data
should be more flexible and context-aware, likening it to "ambassadors"
in negotiations. The piece calls for rethinking data's role in
representing human identity, emphasizing the need for a human-centric
approach to data management that resists power consolidation.

Part of me feels that, sometimes, computer scientists and software
engineers are better at identifying the problems and stakes of media and
digital tools than the academic humanists who purport to be necessary
for ethical development. Really, though, I think those problems are just
becoming so clear that industry practitioners and academics are growing
towards each other.

In any case, this article does an excellent job of laying out the
dangers of data as an objectifying force in a way that coheres with some
of the best academic scholarship on the topic. Schmudde's observations
that "data naturally reduces complex conceptions of identity into coarse
representations" and "data about identity is generally held in systems
far away from the people they identify" essentially summarize the two
broad tendencies of media theory---representationalist and materialist
perspectives (a spectrum, not a binary)---in an accessible manner.
Definitely worth a read.

There are several ideas in this article that piqued my humanistic
interest. What are the stakes of authorship? What does AI remember about
us? Who are we in the now-literal machine of history?

While there are several things I like about scholars like Barthes and
Foucault (and even more things I dislike about Foucault), their critique
of authorship and, moreso, the lazy way in which many humanists read it
is so /obviously/ problematic and wrong. It enabled a cascade of bad
takes from across ideologies based on the assumed good of separating
ideas from their authors. Another phrase for this: erasing context.

Tunney's article here highlights one example of this glaring error and
how it is, sadly, one of the clear
[[https://v2.nl/articles/surfing-the-accident][accidents]] (in Virlio's
sense) of AI tools. Tunney writes:

#+begin_quote
  Open source is a gambit where you give up your leverage to make people
  want your thing. So why would anyone do it full time? It's because
  what I get paid in, is respect. Folks see my name at the top of each
  source code file, and they remember that I was someone who helped
  them. It's because if I'm respected and people are paying attention to
  me, that it becomes easy to find an honest way to survive in the
  modern economy. In the future, this might in fact become the only way
  to survive.

phenomenon in new media and digital scholarship, is a mistake.

In this interview, Paul Virilio discusses the evolving nature of
accidents in modern society. He differentiates between localized,
industrial accidents of the past and the emerging "integral accident" of
the digital age, which is global and systemic. Virilio argues that while
traditional accidents could be contained, modern accidents are pervasive
and interconnected, challenging our ability to control them. He views
accidents as an inevitable part of technological progress and warns that
we must learn to live with these risks rather than seek to eliminate
them.

It is heartening to me that, given the topic and Virilio's general
stance toward technology, the initial summary ChatGPT generated for the
interview was absolutely terrible. It is pretty much unquestionable that
Virilio would have nothing but disdain for ChatGPT. What is more
interesting to me, though, is how this interview from 1998 gives a sense
of his orientation toward progress more succinctly than his writing. He
begins by outlining the historical progression from the localized
technical accident (e.g., a train crash) toward the integral, global
accident that implicates all of us (e.g., the effects of network
technology on the environment). What is fascinating, though, is his
insistence that the goal is not to reject technological "progress" but
to wrestle with it, to face it directly. That's something that hasn't
come across quite as clearly in work I've read from Virilio, so I
appreciated this interview.

Beyond his insights, there are several nostalgia-inducing moments here
from 1998, such as anxiety about the Millenium Bug and references to
Napster. Those, alone, make it worth reading.

Oscar Schwartz's article "Against Rereading" reflects on the tension
between the profound, transformative experience of reading a book for
the first time and the widely celebrated practice of rereading. While
literary greats like Nabokov and Barthes advocate for rereading as a way
to deepen understanding and even produce new meanings, Schwartz remains
skeptical. He argues that the magic of first reading is rooted in its
immediacy, intensity, and emotional resonance, which subsequent readings
might erode. Ultimately, Schwartz suggests that rereading can be a
conservative act, tied to tradition, and at odds with the fleeting, yet

I am a chronic repeater. In large part, this is a symptom of being, for
lack of a better term, a control freak. I remember once reading that
Immanuel Kant lived each of his days /exactly/ the same, down to his
walking patterns in his house, and that this disciplined existence is
associated with his extremely influential philosophical output. This was
in college, and I decided that was how I wanted to live (what the fuck)
and made myself a rigid schedule where every moment of my time was
accounted for. My friend looked at the schedule and asked when I would
have time to go to the bathroom.

I still fetishize the idea of that sort of life but have come to accept
that it is impossible. The paradox, however, is that I have always been
convinced that rereading, or re-consuming (TV shows, films, etc.), the
same texts is generally inferior to reading as diversely and widely as
one possibly can. This, again, is a reaction to my tendency to read and
watch the same things over and over again when left to my own devices.

With that in mind, this article really resonated with me. I am persuaded
both by Schwartz's argument against the unquestioned supremacy of
rereading. I am also very impressed by the depth with which he explores
the argument in favor of rereading, as well. Ultimately, the following
passage reflects my own attitude:

#+begin_quote
  In the end, maybe the crucial difference between those who read once
  and those who reread is an attitude toward time, or more precisely,
  death. The most obvious argument against rereading is, of course, that
  there just isn't enough time. It makes no sense to luxuriate in
  Flaubert's physiognomic details over and over again, unless you think
  you're going to live forever. For those who do not reread, a book is
  like a little life. When it ends, it dies---or it lives on,
  imperfectly and embellished, in your memories. There is a sense of
  loss in this death, but also pleasure. Or as the French might put it,
  la petite mort.
#+end_quote

Again, I'm a control freak.

The article discusses an experiment by a writer hired to produce a
200-word article about a new coffee shop. After completing the task, the
writer wondered if AI tools like ChatGPT could deliver a similar
product. To test this, the writer entered the same press release into
ChatGPT and compared the AI-generated copy to their own work. ChatGPT's
output was slick but filled with clichés and lacked meaningful content
or human appeal. The key critique was that while ChatGPT can generate
grammatically correct and polished text, it struggles to understand what
engages readers on a human level​.

Benedict Evans's article discusses how technological predictions often
ask the wrong questions. He illustrates this with examples of forecasts
from the mid-20th century that missed key developments, like the
internet, focusing instead on less relevant issues. Evans emphasizes
that predicting future tech trends involves more than guessing
advancements---it requires understanding underlying platforms and
frameworks. He also reflects on the importance of questioning
assumptions about what comes next in technology and the potential for

When I was a youthful undergraduate scholar I was afforded the
opportunity to attend an academic conference for honors students across
universities. I only remember a few moments from it, but one of them
comes back to me with surprising frequency. I would guess that I think
about it a few times a month.

Another honors student was giving a presentation on science fiction and
its social commentary. It was, even for an undergraduate honors student
discussing science fiction at a conference, incredibly
techno-optimistic. His essential point was that we can look to histories
of science fiction to historicize our understandings of technology in
the present. I was too shy during the Q&A, but afterward I approached
him and asked (some version of): "Isn't there a possibility that science
fiction could /normalize/ understandings of technology? And couldn't
those normalizations be harmful, wrong, or a combination of both?"

It's hard to capture this and difficult to not sound like I am
overstating, but the presenter's response seemed extraordinarily similar
to what I imagine it would look like if I had asked a question in a
foreign language. For him, science fiction simply charted how
technological progress "actually is." And technological progress, of
course, is good. Keep in mind that this was probably 2011-2012, a time
period of *enormous* techno-optimism. These years and the ones
immediately following were sort of the inverse of the "shot, chaser"
adage. /Look at all of these wonderful new ways to participate in
society./ (Chaser.) /Look at what people, largely, are choosing to do
with that.../ (The most disgusting shot imaginable.)

I'm rambling. My loose point is that this story resonates with what
Evans is talking about here. I may be picking on the student, but
truthfull we *all* extrapolate current visions of technology into the
future in one way or another. I'm persuaded by Evans's call to consider
the unasked questions when we do so.

:END:

Sadly, I have been too busy this past week to read much for the link
roundup and, sadly, that will continue today. So, instead of a set of
links, I figured I'd take this brief blogging time to share some
thoughts on books I've read so far this year that I've enjoyed.

Due to the aforementioned time restriction, don't think of these as full
reviews or full considerations. Several of these books are on my list to
eventually write full posts or even articles about. I'll just share one
or two quick thoughts from each. Their inclusion on this list, itself,
signals my strong recommendation.

- *Confucius, /The Analects./* I've read Confucius several times before,
  but given that I am teaching his ideas in my global rhetorics-based
  writing courses, I decided to do a reread of /The Analects/ toward the
  beginning of the year. I'm about five years back into a formal Zen
  practice, and the cross-contamination between Confucian thought and
  Zen Buddhism was evident in this read. Despite certain overly
  traditionalist and patriarchal elements of Confucian thought, which
  need to be put aside, I really do appreciate the model of the "good"
  that /The Analects/ offers.
- *Brian Hodge, /I'll Bring You the Birds from Out of the Sky./* This
  was just an absolutely stunning cosmic horror novella. The dread of
  certain passages has stuck with me for months, and given that my wife
  is West Virginian the location was especially intriguing.
- *Han Kang, /The Vegetarian./* I don't even know what to say about this
  novel. Most novel readers are aware of it by now but, if you aren't,
  it's an incredibly haunting text told in three parts about the
  dissolution of a Korean family when a woman bucks social norms by
  becoming a vegetarian. The story itself, oddly, has very little to do
  with vegetarianism and more to do with gender roles, patriarchy, and
  social punishment. But those are incomplete thoughts; I'm still
  processing this one.
- *Andrew Culp, /Dark Deleuze./* Culp argues that academics have
  shockingly (note my sarcasm) deradicalized Deleuze's thought. Deleuze
  is my favorite philosopher, or at least the one most influential to my
  general worldview, and I've had Culp's book on my reading list for
  quite a while. It's an odd read for me because I agree wholeheartedly
  with Culp's larger points and don't always appreciate his smaller ones
  in the construction of the argument. The book would be of negative
  interest to anyone not invested in Deleuze, but it's highly worth a
  read for anyone who is.
- *Sarah Manguso, /Ongoingness: The End of a Diary./* Sarah Manguso is
  my favorite living writer. Her book /Siste Viator/ was probably the
  most influential text in getting me to care about language in my
  freshman year of college, and everything I've read by her has left a
  mark. This book focuses on the author's archival obsession and her
  process of releasing it. I don't want to say too much more yet, as I'm
  already working my thoughts into a larger piece, but I can say with
  certainty that this is my favorite book I've read so far, this year.

So, there are some thoughts. Apologies for not having more, but teaching
calls.

:END:

Be warned. This is a rant.

I don't know if you've heard about it, but there's this new technology
on the block. It's making life very difficult for writing teachers.
Worse, it's posing a wave of ethical considerations, especially for
folks like me who usually tend to embrace new technologies
([[/tags/link-roundup][even in this blog]]) and encourage students to do
the same. Obviously, it's AI.

Let me start with some of the bad takes I've seen. By far the worst one
is that AI is similar to other technological developments, and that we
should simply respond to AI in the same ways that we have to those other
ones. Here are two things I have not only heard but have /consistently/
heard from various members of the field of Rhetoric and Writing Studies:

- AI is just like the development of word processors, which radically
  transformed writing. We will just need to use our solid rhetorical
  awareness to teach students how to write in this new context, like we
  have before.
- AI is just like the Internet, which radically transformed writing. We
  will just need to use our solid rhetorical awareness to teach students
  how to write in this new context, like we have before.

If you are reading this and noting the fact that word processors and the
Internet have almost nothing to do with each other, reach out because I
will personally give you a high five if we are ever in the same
vicinity. If you also notice that using them as rationalizations for
embracing AI in the classroom is weird, because AI has actually nothing
to do with word processors and, in the context of writing classrooms,
functionally nothing to do with the Internet, you get two high fives. If
you notice that they are literally the exact same formulaic statement
and based on that probably not too useful I can, I don't know, give you
a dap or something.

Here's a few other takes:

- *Thinking about students using AI unethically frames students as
  cheaters.* Ugh. No, it doesn't. Students, when you ask them, will tell
  you that other professors are /telling them to use AI for writing./
  The difference is that the purpose of those classes isn't to develop
  as a writer. In other words, the learning outcomes of their courses
  don't depend on students NOT using AI tools. Students are *not*
  cheaters; they're tragically getting acontextual, mixed messages from
  across their university.
- *AI is absolutely terrible for the environment and should be banned*.
  Okay, this is a great take. But how far are we willing to go in terms
  of the environmental impact of teaching technology? Take a look into
  the
  [[https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think][environmental
  damage]] and
  [[https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262529969/a-prehistory-of-the-cloud/][geopolitical
  violence]] involved in the Internet and come back to this post. And
  also, what are you going to do when a student uses it anyway after
  their professor in another department teaches it as a tool that
  everyone needs to incorporate into their workflow?
- *The good thing is that AI is not good at [insert genre that is
  specifically related to the course I teach].* Come on. Just, come on.

Let's be honest with ourselves. There is only one justification for
embracing AI in the writing classroom, and it's the one that writing
teachers don't want to admit. /There is nothing, presently, a teacher
can do about it./ Furthermore, the poor ethics and/or inconsistencies of
/any/ response are patently obvious.

Don't believe me? Well, maybe you're one of the following people.

- *I know what student writing looks like and have an always-accurately
  calibrated sense of when I'm reading AI-generated text. I have decided
  to ban AI in my course.* Okay, let's assume that first sentence is
  true. Consider this: You have an international student with English as
  a second language. They use AI to translate your assignments to
  understand them better, then write their essays in their first
  language. Then, they use AI to translate their ideas back into
  English. By the end of the process, their writing is going to look
  markedly similar to AI-generated text and, in a way, it is. But all
  the ideas are their own, they were just originally in a language that
  *you* don't speak or read. Are you comfortable removing a tool that
  helps to level the field for speakers from diverse language
  backgrounds? Are you comfortable failing this student based on your
  felt sense of AI?
- *I will simply discuss issues related to AI-generated text with
  individual students as they arise.* Based on this comment, I know that
  you are not an underpaid non-tenure track or adjunct faculty teaching
  100+ students a semester. In other words, one of the vast majority of
  people actually teaching first-year writing. So, take a moment to
  reflect. How much time is that going to take based on the ubiquity of
  AI tools, and is your position in the university system affecting your
  belief in the possibility of such a strategy? Hey! It is.
- *I will create lesson plans that directly address the ethics of AI and
  include clearly articulated policies regarding its use in my class.*
  First, that is sincerely excellent. You should absolutely do that. But
  what happens when someone violates your clearly articulated policy?
  What do you do? Walk back to where you started and think about the
  question more.
- *I have simply decided not to care about students using AI in my
  classes.* Uh... Do you, I guess? You might consider whether the
  strategy of just ignoring paradigm shifts in how people think about
  writing is a solid look for the field of Rhetoric and Writing Studies.
- *I'm going use one of those AI checker things.* Straight to jail.
  Those technologies don't work.

I really don't have an answer here, except that I truly feel that there
is no way to respond ethically to AI in the writing class at present.
What's worse is that this generally seems to be an issue that
universities are leaving up to individual teachers rather than providing
institutional policies and guidelines. My sense is that the field of
Writing Studies is just about to get over the hump of the celebratory
impulse (new writing technologies!) and get down to the real work of
figuring out what to do. Because, currently, I don't know what to do
about AI, and neither do you.

:END:

Shockingly (to myself), I've fallen into a research project over the
past few months. In the process, I learned a small fact that I just
can't stop thinking about, and it connects to my dissatisfaction about
the takes I've seen response to AI from educators. The connection is
oblique, but bear with me.

In earlier versions of the Western interstate system, the seas were
managed by the freedom of the seas doctrine, which tried to balance
nations' coastal sovereignty against the use of the oceans for trade. In
the 18th century, this doctrine was upheld by a principle referred to as
the cannon-shot rule, where the territory of a state could be said to
extend only one coastal cannon-shot into its adjacent oceans. This crude
technique provided an available technical measurement for "slicing"
Earth within the freedom-of-the-seas doctrine that was held at the time.

A fascinatingly human detail is that it was apparently not considered
that cannons would eventually be made to shoot further, until they
could. As Tirza Meyer writes:

#+begin_quote
  As technology evolved --including even the simple fact that cannon
  range increased -- the necessity to establish exactly how far
  territorial waters reached had become a pressing legal issue by the
  early twentieth century. (43)
#+end_quote

The cannon-shot rule as an interstate agreement, then, required a
fictive reliability, a sense that:

1. a technology would /not/ progress,
and
2. that it could be thoroughly and reliably understood.

The story relates to Paul Virilio's theory of /the accident./ The
accident here refers to the inherent unreliability of technological
progress, the reality that technical development can only be managed up
to a point. As Virilio explained in a
[[https://v2.nl/articles/surfing-the-accident][1998 interview]]:

#+begin_quote
  You cannot separate the accident from reality. The accident is merely
  the other face of substance, and Aristotle defined it already as such.
  According to Aristotle, reality is a mixture of "substans" (i.e. what
  is well established, from the Latin "substare"), and of "accidens"
  (what "falls into," from "accidere"). He characterized "substans" as
  absolute and necessary, and "accidens" as relative and fortuitous.
  Consequently, reality is made up of these two dimensions. As soon as
  something is well established (a substance), it is necessarily
  accompanied by something unreliable, which can trigger off forces
  difficult to contain at any moment. Technology can only progress in a
  struggle against the accident.
#+end_quote

For Virilio, these technological accidents used to be more localized.
But, given the interconnected nature of the modern world-system,
technical accidents have become ever more "integral," that is,
globally-implicating.

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt Paul Virilio
[[file:cannon-shot-epistemology/virilio.jpg]]

What's interesting to me, here, is that the technical accident relies on
a limited knowledge about the future and an inability to predict
technological development. Moreover, the questions we /do/ ask about
technological development
[[https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2017/01/11/wrongquestions][are
often the wrong ones]], because we can't extrapolate present conditions
into the future. This was clearly the case for the establishment of the
cannon-shot rule. It offered an available measurement but couldn't
predict its integral accident, the unknown technical progress of the
cannon and its effects on legal interstate relations.

This inability to reckon with and ultimately face /unknowingness/ is, in
my opinion, /the central/ /problem/ of current conversations about AI in
higher education. We simply don't have a roadmap here. Some would like
to travel the well-worn territory of how we responded to earlier
technologies, which is endearingly human but wrong. Others want to not
engage with the issue at all.

But more and more I feel like higher ed isn't asking the right
questions, either about generative AI's substance or its possible
accidents. Environmental concerns are certainly an obvious integral
accident, not only of AI but of networked technologies in general. But
what other accidents can we try (to the extent that can try) to imagine?

It's worth noting that Virilio was explicitly considering the
possibility of AI in thinking through these questions. In the same
interview, he says:

#+begin_quote
  Well, it is true that the fifth generation computers will not only be
  able to learn but also to bring forth other computers. What bothers me
  most in this idea of self-learning computers is the closed circuit
  character of these systems. The world of computing generally is
  plagued by this closed loop problem, which is what makes it so
  dangerous in the hands of a totalitarian system. In order to avoid
  this "Gleichschaltung," as the Nazis called it, it is necessary to
  structure new computer systems as open systems.
#+end_quote

Even this comment, from 1998, suggests something that academic
institutions are, predictably, ignoring: the proprietary and closed
nature of the AI systems that we will seemingly very likely be building,
in one way or another, into the foundations of learning in years to
come. This may not pose a clear problem now, but there is always an
accident around the corner.

Are we treating AI as the evolving technology that it is? Or are we
spending our time building "cannon shot rules" around ultimately
unstable and undetermined assumptions? I'm starting to think about
"cannon-shot epistemology" to name the ways we build knowledge and
infrastructure on an human but incorrect assumption of stable
technology.

So, what does this look like? Here's an example. When folks in higher ed
conversations /do/ try to imagine the future of AI, they demonstrate
cannon shot epistemology in observably specific ways.

A
[[https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/blogs/online-trending-now/2024/09/25/near-future-vision-ai-higher-ed][recent
opinion piece by Ray Schroeder]] published by /Inside Higher Ed/
demonstrates them. It starts well enough by acknowledging that AI is
outpacing higher education but that we still need to find ways to
imagine its future in order to respond to it effectively. Good. I agree.
This, so far, is exactly right.

But where does Schroeder's imagination take him?

#+begin_quote
  I see us replacing midlevel administrators with intelligent agents
  that can efficiently and effectively make decisions that are
  thoroughly documented and adaptive to changing goals and outcomes.
#+end_quote

One paragraph later:

#+begin_quote
  Startling as it may seem to some, I can see these advanced models,
  such as those with Ph.D. reasoning, filling adjunct faculty posts
  while overseen by human professors. The long-running OpenAI-funded
  Khanmigo project demonstrates that key teaching, tutoring and
  personalization skills can be delivered by generative AI.
#+end_quote

Putting aside the obvious and offensive groundwork being laid *against*
non-tenure faculty and administrative staff, /why is it that everyone's
imagination seems to exhaust itself just before AI could possibly affect
*them?!*/ Elsewhere in this exact same article, Schroeder discusses how
"Multiple societies have been formed and fascinating communities have
been built by intelligent agents." He's talking about Minecraft, which
is embarrassing, but the point is this: he can imagine AI creating
societies, but he can't imagine AI developing one half-inch past firing
contingent labor across the university and (gasp) affecting tenured
faculty. But, why? Why would AI and its integration into higher
education stop there?

This is cannon shot epistemology. Schroeder (and the *many* people who
produce similar self-serving arguments) relies on AI staying exactly
within the boundaries he assigns it in the same article that he admits
that the technology is outpacing us. To be clear, I am not arguing that
one specific outcome *will* occur. Rather, I am just asking us all to
admit that AI and its integration in our lives will develop in
unpredictable ways. With this in mind, maybe we shouldn't normalize the
possibility educators losing their jobs to it. As a thought.

   :END:
Jacques Rancière's /The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons In
Intellectual Emancipation/ is difficult to categorize. Reminiscent of
certain work of Michel Serres and other post-deconstruction French
philosophers, Rancière is more interested in creatively orienting the
reader toward their own thought and humanity than in presenting a
unified philosophical argument. He begins with a seemingly forgettable
curiosity in the history of French pedagogy where Joseph Jacotot taught
Flemish students French with nothing but a single French text and a
complete ignorance of the Flemish language. Across five essays, he
extrapolates Jacotot's method of "universal teaching," that is, helping
students to recognize their intellectual equality without the
explication of "knowledgeable" teacher.

To say the book is about teaching, however, translates only a fragment
of Rancière's inquiry, which dances across topics as seemingly disperse
as the history of Western philosophy and rhetoric; social inequality and
class-systems; the fiction of progressive rationality; and the "secret
of genius" that any student can achieve through an emancipated
self-directed inquiry.

It's helpful to know that this is not a book to be picked up on Friday
to develop a lesson plan for Monday. It *is* a philosophy of pedagogy.
That much is true. But Rancière is not only disinterested in helping
teachers better deliver material to their students; he is critical of
teaching through transmission, referred to throughout the book as
/explication/, entirely.

** Explication and Emancipation
   :PROPERTIES:

   :ID:       0DA9D64B-0819-44EF-852F-545EBF40DE6C
   :END:
Explication refers to any teaching style that assumes knowledge is
"held" by the teacher which the student must, based on the teacher's
interventions of one sort or another, approximate and thereby "learn."
The problem with this method, for Rancière, is the inequality created,
an "enforced stultification" that renders the student definitionally
incapable of ever catching up to the teacher (7, 8). He writes:

#+begin_quote
  There is stultification whenever one intelligence is subordinated to
  another. A person--and a child in particular--may need a master when
  his own will is not strong enough to set him on track and keep him
  there. But that subjection is purely one of will over will. It becomes
  stultification when it links an intelligence to another
  intelligence. . . . We will call the known and maintained difference
  of the two revelations--the act of an intelligence obeying only itself
  even while the will obeys another will--emancipation. (13)
#+end_quote

There are multiple problems with explication. On one hand, it creates a
division between the supposedly superior and inferior intelligences of
the teacher and student, denying the student a full recognition of their
intellectual power that is equally shared across all humans.
Additionally, it produces the academic tendency to separate the
intelligence of the working class and the academic class, rationalizing
and supporting social division (37).

The alternative is termed emancipation. In this model, the "ignorant"
teacher holds no special knowledge, and indeed will often teach what
they themselves do not know. Instead, the teacher's role is to oblige
and authorize students to realize their capabilities of self-learning
through the mediating force of a shared text (a "thing in common"), not
to explicate material for them (15). Put another way, teachers
emancipate by creating conditions for students to immerse themselves in
a "thing in common" and by asking them to share, though their own
language, what they know. The only necessary intervention is to verify
that the student has earnestly and intellectually engaged in a process
of self-learning, not to transmit material /to/ them (31).

Understanding, from this view, isn't a goal but an inherent capability.
The student must realize that knowledge is always and only ever a
process of ongoing translation through the repetition and reworking of
the "thing in common" through language.

#+begin_quote
  There was only one rule: [the student] must be able to show, in the
  book, the materiality of everything he says. He will be asked to write
  compositions and perform improvisations under the same conditions: he
  must use the words and turns of phrase in the book to construct his
  sentences; he must show, in the book, the facts on which his reasoning
  is based. In short, the master must be able to verify in the book the
  materiality of everything the student says. (20)
#+end_quote

Everyone is equally intelligent, and that intelligence can be
emancipated through willful repetition, by "learning, repeating,
imitating, translating, taking apart, putting back together" (55, 68).
Again, these seemingly practical recommendations are made complex by the
fact that /any/ attempt to "lead" the student to a predetermined
conclusion---even using a supposedly Socratic method (29, 58)---falls
back into explication and reproduces a superiority/inferiority of
intellect.

Rancière's argument is expansive---more so, at least, than its slim
pages suggest. I want to touch on just one other element, which is
Rancière's critique of rhetoric. Throughout the book, Ranciére describes
rhetoric as a tool not for "figur[ing] out" but for "be[ing] listened
to" (68). He refers to rhetoric, from this perspective, as "the art
of /reasoning/ that tries to annihilate reason under the guise of
reason" and as a perverted poetry (83-84). Elsewhere, he writes
"Rhetoric is speech in revolt against the poetic condition of the
speaking being. It speaks in order to silence. /You will speak no
longer, you will think no longer, you will do this/: That is it's
program" (85).

*Let me be clear:* If I agreed with this critique entirely, I would be a
very uncomfortable teacher of rhetoric and writing courses, and I would
be very sad about my wasted time earning a Ph.D. Jaded as I am, I still
believe that rhetorical inquiry serves a purpose beyond the application
and maintenance of power.

/Yet/. Rancière's critique of rhetoric does feel uncomfortably salient
and more relevant than I would like. Due to political and economic
realities, the field of English has for some time been largely rebranded
in terms of job preparation and who will be the best operators of
communications technology. In this shifting context, it seems as though
rhetoric, composition, technical communication, and all of the related
disciplines focusing on "real world" communication have gained purchase.
In this movement, the value of language study has been largely reframed
into various versions of the idea that the professional world needs
better communicators---that is, better explicators.

There's nothing wrong with (or, maybe, no way to avoid) this idea as a
part of rhetorical study and a piece of the larger pie of higher
education. But what do we lose when the material conditions of education
make it less and less feasible to give students a book and to honestly,
earnestly ask them what they think, as equals?

Rancière concludes the book with an essay on the impossibility of
institutionalizing universal teaching and closes with the following
line: "The Founder (Jacotot) had predicted it all: universal teaching
wouldn't take. He also added that it would not perish" (139).

    :END:
Kornbluh's diagnosis seems correct. Across domains--writing, video,
theory--there really does seem to be a resistance to anything that
doesn't come neatly packaged, ready to consume. And much of supposedly
"radical" thought is radical in style only, failing to take any sort of
stance or "draw lines." To exist in academic spaces is to see immediacy
style, daily. I am persuaded and fully on board.

That said, I wished, at times, that Kornbluh would draw more lines of
her own. To be clear, I'm not taking up the lazy perspective that a text
fails to enact its own argument. Largely, Kornbluh's does. But her
insistence on the connection of the literary, and mediation broadly, to
political practice seems wedded to an assumption of the importance of
the humanities in a world where that importance has been radically
diminished. In a sense, this isn't even a critique of Kornbluh, because
I agree with her values. Mediation is necessary, and she has convinced
me of the ways that it is under attack. I just wish that there was a bit
less attention to how immediacy affects things like Safdie films, and
more on how it affects labor conditions within the university, for
example. Both topics are there, the balance just seems off. But maybe
(honestly) this desire reflects my own investments in the "immediacy" of
the useful. In any case, the book is well-argued, persuasive, and worth
reading.

Equal parts fantastical and tragic, The Lathe of Heaven is my favorite
Le Guin's novel I've read so far. Among its many themes, one stood out
as particularly significant and ahead of its time. Toward the end of the
novel, Orr is unable to keep track of the various realities affected by
his dreams. "He was living almost as a young child, among actualities
only. He was surprised by nothing, and by everything." How did Le Guin
blow so effortlessly past postmodernism, perfectly capturing the
post-postmodern regression, the complete capitulation to the flow, that
we see today?

The article critiques "tech solutionism," the belief that all problems
can be fixed with technology. It highlights how this attitude, common in
Silicon Valley, often ignores non-technical aspects of issues and
reduces them to problems that require technical fixes. The author
questions the reasoning behind this, suggesting that it's more about a
pro-technology attitude than thoughtful logic. The article also raises
concerns about the normative value placed on technology and the
assumption that it's inherently good, without deeper examination of its
broader societal impact.

Speaking of /The Lathe of Heaven/... Hill here does an excellent job
capturing and considering a strange phenomenon: technologists' strange
inability to grok the idea that technology for technology's sake might
be flawed reasoning. She summarizes this perspective well:

#+begin_quote
  The unspoken foundational claim is not that computing technology
  confers certain benefits, a pragmatic claim, and a matter of fact, but
  that it carries normative value, that it's good; in particular, our
  tech is good, and therefore should be out there in the world.

I tend to take the stance of the "ungenerous critic" she describes.
(/Just how generous does criticism need to be, everybody?/) I'll let you

:END:

I have to assume that /Joker 2: Folie à Deux/ lacked what audiences
loved about Todd Phillip's first /Joker/ film. The assumption is
necessary, because I didn't like the first film either. I found the
breathless discourse about the earlier movie as ridiculous as most
normal people did. But I /was/ put off by its "don't cut yourself on my
edge" ethos, which was---truthfully---a bit boring.

This one, though. /This one, though./ There is always a recency bias
when dealing superlatively, but I haven't come up with a more
frustrating movie than /Folie à Deux/ since seeing it in the theater.
Don't call its narrative difficult. Don't call its genre bending
unbounded. Don't call its refusal of expectations an creative choice by
cinematic /auteur./ Audiences should refuse back, because every one of
these decisions is, today, precisely what makes this film so uncreative.

/Folie à Deux/ bets all of its chips on genre bending as interesting and
subverting expectations as radical. It /begs/ the audience to audience
to accept. /But folks. It is 2024./ These are a few trailers that showed
before /Joker/:

- /Kraven the Hunter./ A Marvel movie that is also an R-rated, violent
  revenge film.
- /Red One./ A Christmas Santa-Claus movie that is also an action movie
  that is also a comedy movie and that is also clearly following the
  Marvel formula.
- /Venom:/ /The Last Dance./ A superhero movie that (whoa guys) /isn't/
  a Marvel film. This one's dark.

/Folie à Deux/, blending genres like the musical, the psychological
thriller, and--/again!/--the superhero movie, pleads with viewers to
accept that it is novel, radical, different.

The problem is, it's not. Today, the genre-bent movie /is the dominant
genre/. Subverted expectations /is the primary expectation of
audiences./ For crying out loud, M. Knight Shyamalan now regularly
/doesn't/ put twists or ambiguity into his movies, which is more
surprising than if he had.

The remainder of /Folie à Deux/, beyond its undelivered-upon demands on
the audience, is boringly offensive and offensively boring. It would
honestly have been more surprising if this film had, after the first
/Joker/, just done the most normative superhero movie possible. I'm
talking spandex. I'm talking costumes with nipples, for some reason. I'm
talking /Zoinks! Boom! Pow!/ All of this would have been more
interesting and, at this point, somehow more original than /Folie à
Deux./

Let's stop making "wouldn't it be weird/cool/interesting if..." movies.
Good ones are good enough.

:END:

I remark often that I was in the last pre-LMS generation. For those
unfamiliar, LMS stands for learning management system, and these systems
are an extremely lucrative industry in higher education. A quick Google
search lets me know the average cost per year for a university is
$75,000, and that this figure doesn't include the attendant hosting
fees, support personnel, ADA compliance officers, and a variety of other
ancillary costs.

The integration of the LMS and their assumed centrality to teaching
happened sometime while I was in graduate school. When I was studying
literature in college from 2009-2013--/shit, statements like that are
the beginning of the end, aren't they?/--classes essentially worked like
this:

- A teacher handed out a course schedule and a syllabus at the beginning
  of the semester. I always read the former and skimmed the latter for
  required books I needed to buy. I truly, honestly cannot remember ever
  reading anything else on a syllabus besides the course title.
- On a day-to-day basis, teachers would remind students of what was due
  by the next class. Usually, these were readings. If I wasn't paying
  attention (a typical situation by the way---this isn't a /kids these
  days/ screed) I would look at the aforementioned course schedule,
  which was probably in my bedroom somewhere. If not, I imagine I found
  another copy. I don't remember how.
- Sometimes, the teacher would then hand out other sheets of paper
  called assignments. They would explain the assignments, and then
  students would go do them to the best of their ability, meeting with
  the teacher during their office hours as necessary.
- A grade was given at the end of the semester. Given that I never read
  a syllabus, the way these were calculated remains something of a
  mystery to me.

Essentially, the entire course was managed by teacher circulating
print-based documents in class. This was a highly imperfect system for
all sorts of reasons. But there are a few things it encouraged that were
highly positive: attending class, the value of listening (even though,
as mentioned, I often wasn't), personal organization, and in-person
interaction with a teacher.

I remember my first introduction to an LMS. A literature professor used
Blackboard (a popular LMS), which she correctly identified as the future
of education. She still circulated all the same documents, though, and I
tried my best to ignore Blackboard.

Eventually, we were required to take an in-class quiz using her LMS, and
I could ignore it no longer. We were told to bring a computer to class,
which seemed very dumb to me in the context of a literature course.
Wasn't it easier just to take the quiz on paper? Whatever. I opened up
the quiz on Blackboard and reviewed the questions. I was sitting at the
back of the room and looked up. What I saw was about 75% of students
cheating on the quiz.

*Dear Critical Reader:* I do not think all or most students, in general,
are cheating. I'll go even further and say that I think quizzes on
literary texts are, themselves, a largely unproductive genre. And if a
teacher is giving a quiz proctored through a networked computer,
honestly, whatever happens happens. That's on you.

It's just the case that almost everyone on that day was cheating. And it
set the tone---fairly or unfairly---for my view on these systems in
general. Learning management systems solve a lot of problems. And they
certainly enable important interactions for online classes. But for
in-person classes, they've fostered a "web-first" assumption on the part
of teachers /and/ students that, in the final account, bad.

It's bad because it affords new types of cheating, sure, but I don't
really care much about that. These systems are truly bad several other
reasons:

- *Reason 1.* They completely alter the relationship between teachers
  and students, putting an incredibly poorly designed technology between
  them and telling both parties that they "solve" the "problem" of
  course communication.
- *Reason 2:* They track everything students and teachers do on and with
  them. This is both a privacy issue and a labor issue.
- *Reason 3:* They tell their audiences that their primary purpose is
  *Reason 1* when it is actually *Reason 2*. *Reason 2* provides data
  that is given back to both universities and private companies, which
  they then use/sell to earn profits in ways that are not only unrelated
  to but often in opposition to teaching and learning.
- *Reason 4:* Students, when you ask them, don't even like these
  systems.
- *Reason 5:* The LMS are now /widely assumed to be the class itself,/
  not a tool used by a teacher within a larger class setting. This is
  demonstrated constantly by the language that surrounds them. Before
  the semester: "Do you have your class posted?" "Yeah I'm almost there.
  I just need to work on my classes a bit."

I've taken to call this LMS-assumption "content management pedagogy."
Content management, to be clear, is the productive and necessary
technical writing skill of managing and designing content for users.
Content management pedagogy is the typically unproductive and
less-necessary phenomenon where the processing and management of course
material becomes unconsciously synonymous with teaching and learning.
Content management pedagogy is evident when teachers are forced to spend
valuable time (that could be used to design learning activities, for
instance) updating overly complicated and borderline legalistic
documents across multiple sections of a single course. Content
management pedagogy accounts for the feeling that we're teaching online
courses when we're /in/ the classroom, opening online materials for
in-person students who all have computers or phones. Content management
pedagogy is what trains us all that a 20-email thread to *not* answer a
question is flexible, accommodating efficiency, while answering that
same question in four seconds in class is limiting.

The culprit here is, and never could be, students or teachers. It's that
technology changes the delivery of learning. It's the LMS. And it's bad.

In his essay on /M/, Fritz Lang reflects on his decision to base the
film on real events, inspired by news reports of unsolved murders and
the public's fear in Weimar Germany. Lang aimed to create a work that
would educate and warn society, highlighting the dangers of unchecked
violence and the lurking threat of criminal behavior. He used factual
details to intensify the film's impact, hoping to foster awareness and
perhaps even prevent future tragedies by illustrating the ordinary
settings where horror can unfold.

It's always surprising to me just how quickly film became... good and
how quickly innovation in the medium slowed down. This 1931 film shows
its age in a number of ways, but they mainly have to do with stylistic
elements and genre features: the allowing of actual silence, for
example. In terms of story, cinematography, and social commentary, /M/
is incredible and far less dated than one would think.

Fritz Lang's own thoughts on his film are fascinating. Two quotes stand
out. The first:

#+begin_quote
  a more substantial responsibility than the artistic reproduction of
  events: the responsibility of sounding a warning from real events, of
  educating, and in this way ultimately having a preventive effect. It
  would go beyond the scope of this brief comment to dwell on the means
  open to such a film to draw attention to the dangers that, given an
  incessantly growing crime rate, spell threat and, sadly, all too
  often, disaster for people at large, children and youngsters in
  particular; to illuminate the ordinariness and banality with which
  they announce themselves; to educate; and, most important of all, to
  have a preventive impact.
#+end_quote

So much for the arguments that movies today are bad because they are too
socially oriented. In fact, the exact inverse is true: films today fail
when they assume a /false/ stance of social justice that, in reality,
serves only as a money-printing machine for studios. This is certainly
not true of all films today (there is an embarrassment of good ones),
but there is a tendency not toward actual social issues but toward
pleasing the audience that has, really, run its course. Which leads to
the second quote:

#+begin_quote
  the film should give the impression at certain points of a moving
  spotlight, revealing with greatest clarity the thing on which its cone
  of light is directed at the time: the grotesqueness of an audience
  infected with a murder psychosis, on the one hand, and the gruesome
  monotony with which an unknown murderer, armed with a few candies, an
  apple, a toy, can spell disaster for any child in the street, any
  child outside the protection of his family or the authorities.
#+end_quote

What is wonderful about /M/ is that it is truly an uncomfortable
indictment of society's contradictions rather than what we get today:
movies that are about one edgy douche "against" "society." Ultimately,
Beckert's terrible actions are just a foil, a machine error that allows
his society to fully reveal itself as a character, and an unreliable
one. And it's interesting how purposeful Lang was in implicating the
audience in that unreliability.

:ID:       C585641E-0BF6-46DC-841A-7FCAC36DAD92
:END:

I fell off the radar a bit at the end of the year but I'm back. I'll be
restarting the regular posts soon, but I have a couple 2024 wrap-ups
coming first.

First, here's a collection of thoughts on the books I read this year.
They aren't quite reviews and they aren't (as you might notice)
completely independent of each other. Most of the content is new, but
some of it has been included/reworked from earlier posts.

If you have thoughts on these books, have read them, or simply want more
on one of several of them. Let me know in the comments below.

1.  *Stephen Graham Jones: /My Heart is a Chainsaw./* My favorite aspect
    of this book is the narrator's obsessive focus on genre. That being
    said, the fact that the book is /not/ actually the genre it purports
    to be actually became quite confusing by its end.
2.  *Confucius: /The Analects/*. I've read Confucius several times
    before but, given that I am now teaching his ideas in my global
    rhetorics-based writing courses, I decided to do a reread of /The
    Analects/ toward the beginning of the year. I'm about five years
    back into a formal Zen practice, and the cross-contamination between
    Confucian thought and Zen Buddhism was evident in this read. Despite
    certain overly traditionalist and patriarchal elements of Confucian
    thought, which need to be put aside, I really do appreciate the
    model of the "good" that The Analects otherwise offers.
3.  *Nietzsche: /The Genealogy of Morals./* It's Nietzsche. What else
    new could I say? Maybe this: Nietzsche's understanding of Buddhism
    is so wrong it is laughable. That doesn't mean I didn't like it but,
    again, what else could I possibly add the discussion of one of the
    most important thinkers of the Western tradition?
4.  *Stephen King: /It./* This is, sadly, one of my least favorite books
    of all time. I regret saying this not only for the amount of time I
    spent reading it but also because I feel ridiculous being critical
    of Stephen King. In the same way as the /The Stand/ (everything I
    say here applies equally, or moreso, to that book) I wanted to like
    this because, well, /it's Stephen King/. But I simply could not get
    past how indulgent and offensive the writing was. On the latter
    point, /IT/ goes well-beyond being a "time and place" thing and
    really is just actively bad in terms of its representation of nearly
    every category of person included in the book. I do plan to give
    King another shot this year to see if there's anything that clicks.
    The book I choose will be substantially shorter.
5.  *Simon Reynolds: /Rip it Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-1984./*
    /Rip it Up/ was a fantastic read and gave me a language and a
    historical context for several of my favorite bands. It also taught
    me that a surprising amount of groups I like from this period
    (luckily none of my absolute favorites) were playing /very/ fast and
    loose with fascist/Nazi aesthetics. This sucks. But I'd rather know
    it than not know it.
6.  *Brian Hodge: /I'll Bring You the Birds from Out of the Sky./* This
    was just an absolutely stunning cosmic horror novella. The dread of
    certain passages has stuck with me for months and given that my wife
    is West Virginian the location was especially intriguing.
7.  *Han Kang: /The Vegetarian/*: I (still) don't even know what to say
    about this novel. Most "literary" readers are aware of it by now
    but, if you aren't, it's an incredibly haunting text told in three
    parts about the dissolution of a Korean family when a woman bucks
    social norms by becoming a vegetarian. The story itself, oddly, has
    very little to do with vegetarianism and more to do with gender
    roles, patriarchy, and social punishment. A must-read.
8.  *Sara Gran: /Come Closer./* If you like horror novels, you need to
    read this book. It's haunting, psychological, demonic. It's so
    incredibly fucked up. I rarely actually get spooked by reading
    horror---this one spooked me good.
9.  *Dan John: /Mass Made Simple./* I am slowly reading everything Dan
    John writes about fitness and lifting weights. I'm unsure if I'll
    ever run this particular program, but it's filled to the brim with
    insights about the practice of weight training in general.
10. *Oliver Burkeman: /Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for
    Mortals./* A few times a year, I usually indulge in my guilty
    pleasure of reading a few productivity/self-help books. I nearly
    never get anything out of them, but I enjoy them for some reason.
    Burkeman's, however, is the rare kind that is actually useful,
    normal, applicable to a real person, and worth spending the time
    reading.
11. *Mihály Csíkszentmihályi: /Flow: The Psychology of Optimal
    Experience./* This one is the other, more common kind. I recommend
    reading one of the eight million blog posts about this book, as
    that's about the amount of information it contains when you remove
    redundancy.
12. *Andrew Culp: /Dark Deleuze./* Culp argues that academics have
    shockingly (note my sarcasm) deradicalized Deleuze's thought.
    Deleuze is my favorite Western philosopher, or at least the one most
    influential to my general worldview, and I've had Culp's book on my
    reading list for quite a while. It's an odd read for me because I
    agree wholeheartedly with Culp's larger points and don't always
    appreciate his smaller ones in the construction of the argument. The
    book would be of negative interest to anyone not invested in
    Deleuze, but it's highly worth a read for anyone who is.
13. *Immanuel Wallerstein: /World-Systems Analysis: An Introduction./*
    One of the most fascinating academic books I've ever read. I have
    since read a number of academic articles from the field of sociology
    that touch on (positively and critically) world-systems analysis and
    I must say that I'm very persuaded by it as a critical lens for
    making sense of the world.
14. *Paul Virilio: /Speed and Politics:/* Virilio got a lot of play on
    my blog this year. (See
    [[/posts/2024/09/link-roundup-september-2-2024/][here]] and
    [[/posts/2024/09/cannon-shot-epistemology/][here]].) The idea that
    we're all caught up in "habitable circulation" is intriguing and
    useful for considering the world around me, despite being at this
    point a bit of a cliché.
15. *Plato: /The Trial and Death of Socrates./* In the age of artificial
    intelligence, I find reading Socrates more and more refreshing. I
    still disagree on many fundamental conclusions he draws, but
    Socratic dialogue and---more fundamentally---the ability to say that
    certain things are /bad/ are practices I think we need to recover.
16. *Paul Kelso: /Powerlifting Basics: Texas Style./* Dumb as hell, but
    fun.
17. *Sarah Manguso: /Ongoingness: The End of a Diary./* Sarah Manguso is
    my favorite living writer. /Siste Viator/ was probably the most
    influential text for me in college, and everything I've read by her
    has left a mark. This book focuses on the author's archival
    obsession and her process of releasing it. It is, to me, an
    absolutely essential read.
18. *Claudia Rankine: /Citizen: An American Lyric/*: It's hard to
    actually say anything about this powerful book, which feels like a
    cop-out. I'm sorry for that. Its experimental, multimediated
    construction was a fascinating way for Rankine to deliver her
    perspective on race in America.
19. *Reb Anderson: /Being Upright: Zen Meditation and Bodhisattva
    Precepts./* A collection of practices I hope to deepen in 2025.
20. *Immanuel Wallerstein: /Historical Capitalism with Capitalist
    Civilization./* Once again: world-systems analysis is good.
21. *Oliver Onions: /The Beckoning Fair One./* Lovecraft without the
    extraordinary racism that losers on the Internet try to pretend
    isn't there. A great ghost story.
22. *Jacques Rancière: /The Ignorant Schoolmaster./* Probably one of the
    best books on teaching I've read. Rather than rehash them, I
    encourage you to read
    [[/posts/2024/09/the-ignorant-schoolmaster-five-lessons-in-intellectual-emancipation-a-review/][my
    extended thoughts here]].
23. *Ursula K. Leguin: /The Lathe of Heaven./* Equal parts fantastical
    and tragic, /The Lathe of Heaven/ is my favorite Le Guin novel I've
    read so far. Among its many themes, one stood out as particularly
    significant and ahead of its time. Toward the end of the novel, Orr
    is unable to keep track of the various realities affected by his
    dreams. "He was living almost as a young child, among actualities
    only. He was surprised by nothing, and by everything." How did Le
    Guin blow so effortlessly past postmodernism, perfectly capturing
    the post-postmodern regression, the complete capitulation to the
    flow, that we see today?
24. *Anna Kornbluh: /Immediacy: Or, The Style of Too Late Capitalism./*
    A good book of social theory. I was more persuaded by it when I read
    it than I am now, especially after the publication and seemingly
    near-universal praise of /Intermezzo/, which feels exactly like the
    type of book/phenomenon that Kornbluh says is less possible these
    days. See my [[/posts/2024/10/link-roundup-october-8-2024/][earlier,
    actual review]] for more.
25. *Samuel Beckett: /Waiting for Godot/.* Reading this in high school
    was honestly the thing that spawned my love of the humanities,
    literature, philosophy, being a fashionably/unfashionably literary
    person (an imaginary type of person, of course), etc. I was
    disappointed to find that it really didn't hit the same for me as a
    34-year-old in 2024. The sad truth is that the world lacking meaning
    doesn't seem radical or even particularly interesting anymore. The
    world is absurd! Yep. The real question today, I think, is how do we
    get the meaning back in?
26. *Ta-Nehisi Coates: /The Message./* Coates trying desperately to
    consider how writers can get the meaning, and the truth, back in.
    Another essential read.
27. *Dean Young: /The Art of Recklessness./* I picked this up for no
    reason when I was between books and unsure what to read next. I've
    had it since a college poetry class, and this was a re-read. Was it
    interesting? Yeah. Was it useful/sticky for me as a non-poet? I'm
    undecided.
28. */The Táin: From the Irish Epic Táin Bó Cúailinge./* Irish warrior
    mythology? Yes please. It was a bonus to learn that the Irish
    clearly invented "going super-saiyan," as Cú Chulainn does so,
    repeatedly, in this epic.
29. *G. Bruce Boyer: /True Style: The History and Principles of Classic
    Menswear./* It is somewhat embarrassing to say out loud (much less
    write on my blog) that I am in the process of improving and, maybe
    more accurately, becoming more intentional about my sartorial
    choices. What I didn't know is that Boyer (and many others) have
    done so much work situating men's fashion within a larger
    sociological history. This is the only full book on fashion I've
    taken this year, but I've read many (/many/) more articles, and
    menswear is becoming almost as equally an intellectual rabbit-hole
    as practice-based one.
30. *Sally Rooney: /Intermezzo./* I'm noticing that /everyone/ is
    reading this book now. They are right to do so; it's a masterpiece.
    It perfectly captures the modern affect. I cried at the end.
31. *Ryan Gattis: /All Involved./* A fascinating research-based fiction
    novel set during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. I strongly encourage
    you to at least watch Gattis explain some of the backstory involved
    in writing it which is...
    [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjK7sTdU72w][incredible]] and

:END:

I've been a bit slow on the blog here at the start of the year. A lot of
my attention has been dedicated to getting my Spring classes off the
ground. I redesigned both my professional writing and research writing
courses pretty extensively this semester. What I didn't account for was
a mysterious missing week in our break this year...

Excuses aside, I am committing to resuming my [[/tags/link-roundup][link
roundups]] next week. Actually, I would have one this week, but I
decided to finish a 2024 film post instead.

Like everyone with too much free time and an interest in movies, I love
Letterboxd. In fact, before I get into the post, go ahead and follow me
on [[https://letterboxd.com/rickwysocki/][Letterboxd]]. Come on, let's
be friends.

Toward the end of the year, I realized that Letterboxd allows you to
export your data as a .csv file. Immediately, I knew what I would be
doing: data visualizations with [[https://d3js.org/][d3.js]].

Did I know how to use d3.js? No. But I know enough JavaScript to be
dangerous and am a generally obsessive person. I actually /was/ able to
generate a variety of visualizations of my 2024 cinematic experience.
The problem came when I tried to move these visualizations out of
[[https://observablehq.com/platform/notebooks][Observable]]. I realized
I needed a bit more learning time than I wanted to spend before
actually... writing this post. No matter: I'll learn it later.

What you'll see below:

1. A set of handsome and spunky visualizations of my 2024 Letterboxd
   data. Just kidding: they're very straightforward Google Sheets
   charts. But, hey, they work.
2. A table of most of my raw data for the year. I've omitted my actual,
   often embarrassing reviews, but I've included the URI links to them
   in case you really are interested.

*A quick note:* These are pretty bare bones insights, and this post was
really about the journey more than the end product. The most exciting
part of learning I could export my data was visualizing genres but,
sadly, genre doesn't seem to be included in the data set. I looked into
whether Letterboxd has a public API, and it doesn't. Web scraping is a
possibility, but I don't currently have that kind of time. If ANYONE has
ideas or recommendations for exporting a user's film data, including
genre, I *beg* you to let me know in the comments or send me an email.

Okay, onto the visuals.

I try to maintain a simple ethos on Letterboxd: only you (I) can fight
rating inflation. Looking at the data, I feel like I've failed at that
goal. On the other hand, my statician friend reminded me once that
people tend to seek out movies that are good and not ones that are bad,
so it makes sense for their to be a bit of a curve upward. So maybe I am
holding my position better than I think.

At first, I was surprised here. I'm not pretentious when it comes to
movies (at least, I don't think I am). If asked whether I tend toward
watch older or contemporary films, though, I'd say older ones.

This visualization, though, shows a clear spike in 2024 and more
relatively films than I'd expect in the 2020s. Thinking about it more, I
first realized that my buddy Ari and I (I told him I'd give him a
shout-out) go see a lot of new films in the theater, so the 2024 bump
made sense.

I was still surprised by the distribution. But as I always tell my
students, the subjective decisions involved in representing data tell
/particular/ stories, not absolute ones. And I felt stupid, having
clearly forgot that, when I parsed the data another way.

sense.

Now, we've got a much more visually-even distribution across several
decades. I am slightly embarrassed that I watched no movies from the
1950s, however, since that's ostensibly my favorite decade in film.

Hey there. At long last, I'm back with a link roundup. There's a smmall
change this week and it's likely going to carry forward. I'm dropping
the AI summaries.

I remain unfashionably somewhere in between "AI is your new master and
has changed everything about your job" and "AI will kill you,
singlehandedly destroy the environment, disrespect your dog, and bring
Kid Rock back to the forefront of popular music." There is a middle
ground. /I believe./

Still. I just don't think the landscape needs totally meaningless uses
of AI. And /most/ of the uses already feel pretty unnecessary, honestly.
I've used ChatGPT to help me understand some code while contributing
documentation to an open source project, and it was wonderfully
valuable. I've used it to help me think through holes in a lesson plan.
And it helped. But the one thing everyone seems to think AI is going to
replace--writing--is the area it both feels least necessary and most
limited.

I don't want to add energy to that. At least for the time being. So I'm
losing the generated summaries. I don't think anyone will mind.

I can't explain how nostalgic this post made me for the pre-2.0
Internet. For a brief summary, Schuster tells a story of him and his
friends in junior high discovering the possibilities for command-line
shenanigans. It's short, funny, and you should read it on your own.

It reminded me of a similar story from my high school, though. One day,
a class clown-type student discovered that the rudimentary high school
email system that literally no one used could send emails to *every*
student without CC'ing any teachers or administrators. He used his power
to organize equally hilarious and weird displays at our football games.

In my old age, I can only remember one of them, but it was so funny I
think it will always stick with me. In one of his strange emails, he
cryptically explained that at a certain moment, in a certain quarter,
everyone was to act as though an army of spiders was advancing from the
opposite end of the field. Incredibly, we all did, and the confusion it
momentarily caused is still funny to me today.

continue my now years-long project of decreasing the role of social
media in my life. Honestly, I've done an embarrassing amount of reading
about reverting to an RSS-based model for web consumption, and a lot of
the suggestions in this article are things I am actively doing or have
tried in the past.

Still, I implore /you/: take a look at this great post and see if an RSS
feed might make sense to you. The old Internet had a lot good things
going for it. The new one has a lot of bad.

Phew! This semester is kicking my ass. Somehow I've started on the back
foot and have been busy since day one. That said, I've got two
interesting articles here touching on how we hide unethical behavior as
"apps" and the seeming need to dependencize everything. (I made up the
word dependencize; don't blame the author.)

See the articles and some of my own thoughts below.

   :END:
[[https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/25/potatotrac/#carbo-loading][Link to
Article]]

This article feels relevant as AI speculation dips today (I've seen
folks refer to it as a counter-slap against "tech-bros"). Doctorow
explains how an app called "Potatotrac" is used by a company to fix the
prices of potatoes across the country. If it weren't done "with an app,"
he observes, we'd all recognize it as a crime.

#+begin_quote
  Big Potato controls 97% of the frozen potato market, and any sector
  that large and concentrated is going to be pretty cozy. The execs at
  these companies all meet at industry associations, lobbying bodies,
  and as they job-hop between companies in the cartel. But they don't
  have to rely on personal connections to rig the price of potatoes:
  they do it through a third-party data-broker called Potatotrac. Each
  cartel member sends all their commercially sensitive data -- supply
  costs, pricing, sales figures -- to Potatotrac, and then Potatotrac
  uses that data to give "advice" to the cartel members about "optimal
  pricing."
#+end_quote

Alongside the stock market news,
[[https://apnews.com/article/trump-inflation-grocery-prices-energy-production-consumers-c8afa45fc2b44471d55a1516e99ea351][AP
News reported yesterday]] that inflation--the issue that likely led many
voters to erroneously hand him the election--is already working its way
down his list of priorities:

#+begin_quote
  "They all said inflation was the No. 1 issue. I said, 'I disagree,'"
  Trump said. "I talked about inflation too, but how many times can you
  say that an apple has doubled in cost?"
#+end_quote

It's hard to tell how many times the US will fall for the same bait and
switch. Given the rise of AI, as well as the disparate moves by tech
conglomerates to consolidate political and economic power, it's useful
to use Doctorow's idea to ask ourselves: what are we and others letting
slide because it comes with an app?

A bit less to say here, except that I've been noticing the phenomenon
described by the author (a craze for dependencies) crop up elsewhere.
Recently, I've finally succumbed to Emacs, and its slowly starting to
become the central tool for a lot of my work. I've noticed, though, that
when you look at forums and other resources online, there is *so much*
advice to install packages. I can't speak for others, but I know that if
I was taking that advice rather than building my own tools using
existing documentation and resources for vanilla Emacs/org-mode (aside:
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQS06Qjnkcc&list=PLVtKhBrRV_ZkPnBtt_TD1Cs9PJlU0IIdE][my
favorite resource so far]]) I would know precisely nothing about the
tool rather than... some. Let's go with some.

Building it yourself might not always be attainable, but it does feel
like a universally good thought to start with.

The semester continues, the news rages on, and the world gets worse. The
latter two items aren't related to the first, except that they all are
reasons I won't have a fully featured link roundup this week. I've just
been swamped with teaching, feelings, and also with continuing to work
on a research project that's been on my mind... forever. More on that if
I ever get to a full manuscript.

So, what I'll offer instead is a few book reviews. I've decided to
finally leave Goodreads, and will now be posting my short reviews on the
decentralized alternative Bookwyrm.

** Percival Everett, /James/

This novel, focused on the practice and clearly the legacy of slavery in
the United States, is both amazing and harrowing. The only book that
comes to mind to associate the feeling of reading /James/ is Toni
Morrison's /Beloved/, which shook me in a similar fashion despite having
a completely different approach to the topic.

In /James/, Everett reclaims the character Jim from /Huckleberry Finn/,
re-telling the story from his perspective. I hadn't read /Huckleberry
Finn/ since I was a kid, and truthfully I appreciated not having re-read
it before jumping into Everett's reclamation. There is just so much to
think about in /James/ as a standalone novel, from the commentary on
marginalized language practices, to the abominable history of slavery,
to the subtle indication that the character James wrote the the actual
book held by the reader. I strongly recommend this one.

** Rita Bullwinkel, /Headshot/

This book was really engaging in terms form, but it didn't captivate me
much in terms of content. I think the project of a cross-temporal novel
told totally through interiority is interesting, but as strange as it
sounds I came away feeling like I still didn't really know the
characters. I wondered at times if it was simply my not having the
experience of girlhood (which is the organizing theme of the book), and
I do think that's likely the main issue. So whatever qualms I have about
the book (and, again, I think it's extraordinarily unique and
fascinating) have more to do with me than anything else.

** Kurt Vonnegut, /Breakfast of Champions/

I'm about to say something bordering on sacrilege for a book-person
sitting in Indiana: I did not like this at all. The last 20-30 pages
were an incredible (short) book and admittedly brought the slog through
the preceding 270 into focus. And I'm open to Vonnegut's project of
"total life through art" and his critique of narrative reality.

But, man, this book was tedious. And while it's clear that Vonnegut was
depicting racism, sexism, and homophobia in order to condemn them, he
just wasn't landing the tricks.

I haven't read anything particulary link-roundup-worthy this week. But I
have been working in my zettelkasten system a bit. So, instead of links,
I'll post some thoughts I've been writing notes about.

--------------

** A definition.
   :PROPERTIES:

   :END:
You can read [[/posts/2022/06/what-is-genre/][my earlier post]] about
genre for more theory, but I explain genre to my students like this:
genres are *types* of communication with particular *conventions*
expected by *audiences*. There's lots more to talk about, but that's the
common denominator.

This post builds on that basic definition with three ideas:

1. There has pretty much always been a debate about whether
   genre-thinking and its effects are positive or negative.
2. Different disciplines lean more positive or more critical in terms of
   genre and its effects, though they're usually more optimistic by
   default.
3. Given the absolutely devastated landscape of public discourse, and
   more critical attitude to how we can sometimes /be used by genres/
   may be useful.

These thoughts will be brief and unproven. I'm just tossing some
thoughts around, really.

** Point one.
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: point-one.
   :ID:       2F22CBE3-FB51-4115-9E17-B5194606850D
   :END:
The debate about genre's effects on freedom and possibility extend back
to tensions between dialectic (philosophy) and rhetoric in Ancient
Greece. Plato, for example, saw genre leading communicators toward
repetitive practices, emptying the possibilities for truth-seeking.
Alternatively, rhetoricians like Isocrates believed that mastering the
genres of communication was both art and public education and cultural
continuity. Think of it this way: Plato saw genres as cultural mad libs
that cut off your ability to think. Isocrates saw them as communication
tools that help audiences understand what you're talking about. These
metaphors are extremely reductive. But they're not wrong.

** Point two.
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: point-two.
   :ID:       BFDEDE55-7EE7-49C6-8EA7-17924FD95B91
   :END:
Today, rhetorical studies and the fields associated with it
understandably lean more toward the latter perspective. As we worked to
refine and define the term for our purposes rather than those of other
fields, the "social view" was emphasized. The social view extends
Isocrates's point that we use genres to do things. These things may not
always be positive, but its usually assumed that human beings are using
genres, and not the other way around. The social view isn't unique to
rhetoric, it's well explored in other disciplines like film studies,
too.

** Point three.
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: point-three.
   :ID:       55025C07-F289-4A21-91C4-6A3C19B22744
   :END:
However, film studies has arguably been more attentive to the economic,
industry-based, and market-incentivized nature of the production,
circulation, and consumption of genre than rhetorical studies. This is
pretty natural, for a few reasons. Film studies has more narrow focus
(the film industry), with relatively fewer texts (films) presented in
relatively small set of genres (the film genres). By contrast,
rhetorical studies since its foundation has claimed an infinite focus
(see Aristotle's definition of rhetoric as a meta-discipline), a
seemingly infinite possible selection of texts, presented in a seemingly
infinite possible selection of genres. This wide berth, to be sure,
fostered a compellingly wide set of topics for rhetorical scholarship.
But they also don't give us a "central location" to analyze things like
the market production of genres and their conventions.

I think writing and communication genres, especially those that are
highly-incentivized by market forces and with a strong possibility for
audience capture, could be considered in more critical ways. Here a few
questions I'm thinking about to close the post:

- How are the conventions of writing platforms like Substack actually
  /producing/ economically-justified political contrarianism? In what
  ways are writers actually being used by the genre?
- How are conventions of podcasting actually incentivizing toxic and
  stupid things like the manosphere, generalized mysoginy, and online
  betting? Again, to what degree is the genre and its conventions
  actually participating in creating the effect?
- How are the conventions of video platforms (I'm thinking YouTube, but
  I'm sure TikTok is even worse) doubling back on themselves and sort of
  demanding a race to the bottom in terms of discourse?

None of this should absolve individuals from creating harmful content
(human agency is still there of course) but more thinking about the
normative, repetive aspects of genre seem kind of important at present.
Maybe we need just a little bit more Plato and just a little bit less
Isocrates?

* DONE Less Nerd, More Punk

During times of global crisis (looks out on the world), I respond in a
few predictable ways:

1. I try to deepen my practice of Zen Buddhism. (Bad situation, good
   situation.)
2. I try to go a little harder in the weight room. (It honestly does
   help my mental state.)
3. I try to minimize my reliance on gigantic technology corporation.

In this short post, I just want to talk a little bit about that third
one.

I'm somewhat strange in my hobbies. I am NOT a programmer (I dabble, but
it's not my area of expertise) but spend a LOT of time exploring and
learning about tools and technolgoy that typically would only interest
programmers. Random examples include things like Git/GitHub, working in
the terminal, basic programming, a variety of text editors, Linux (even
though my daily driver is a Mac), etc. These are all things that
wouldn't be super impressive to the average programmer, but I've been
told by students that it's surprising to have an English professor be so
"techy."

What I enjoy, specifically, is finding ways that tech can improve my
workflow and, even more importantly, put more control over that workflow
in *my* hands rather than in the design choices of sometimes (always)
unethical corporations.

People who know the term know that I'm hinting at an interest in FOSS,
but I'm not even going to talk about that here. Because I think
conversations about technology usually presuppose a binary choice
between only two types of users:

- Nerds who know what FOSS stands for.
- Normal people who don't give a shit.

Of course, the deeper waters of tech *are* a niche interest. But we sort
of forget that the situation FOSS attempts to bring about (a healthy
relationship with tech) is something that /anyone/ can get behind.
Additionally, this binary cedes too much ground to the negative aspects
of nerds.

To be clear, when I say nerds for the remainder of this post, I'm
referring to people who claim technical knowledge as arcane, who flex
(not share) that knowledge over others, and who ultimately see
themselves as better than other people because they know how to query a
database. (As an aside: I've learned a lot of stuff as a non-programmer,
and none of this shit is really /that/ complicated). These types of
nerds (hereafter, just nerds) are actively ruining the world.

But there's another way of thinking about the development of "technical"
knowledge outside the binary of "nerds" and "normal people."
Essentially, it's the punk ethos: do-it-yourself and try not to buy
things.

I've never been punk. There's a lot of punk music I love, but I've never
been a part of the actual culture. But I admire the spirit, and think
it's a healthy attitude to take toward our digital lives. Instead of
buying something (either with our money or, more likely these, the
commodification of our lives by way of data), we could ask ourselves
"can I do it myself?" If we know how to do something, can we teach it to
others?

The nerd ethos: Mastodon is perfectly usable as-is and you're a bad
person for using BlueSky. The punk ethos: not everyone knows everything,
BlueSky is way better than Twitter, and maybe I can create documentation
for others to get set up on the platform.

The nerd ethos: a single non-FOSS application on your computer is a sin.
The punk ethos: digital participation isn't an individual endeavor.
We're in this together. You can't just delete everything (and everyone)
from your digital; life at once. You've got to be strategic and often
move slow.

As I'm trying to move (one step at a time) toward a healthier digital
existence, I'm trying to remember that DIY is a process. You can't do
everything at once.
