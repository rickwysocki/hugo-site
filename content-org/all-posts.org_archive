I remark often that I was in the last pre-LMS generation. For those
unfamiliar, LMS stands for learning management system, and these systems
are an extremely lucrative industry in higher education. A quick Google
search lets me know the average cost per year for a university is
$75,000, and that this figure doesn't include the attendant hosting
fees, support personnel, ADA compliance officers, and a variety of other
ancillary costs.

The integration of the LMS and their assumed centrality to teaching
happened sometime while I was in graduate school. When I was studying
literature in college from 2009-2013--/shit, statements like that are
the beginning of the end, aren't they?/--classes essentially worked like
this:

- A teacher handed out a course schedule and a syllabus at the beginning
  of the semester. I always read the former and skimmed the latter for
  required books I needed to buy. I truly, honestly cannot remember ever
  reading anything else on a syllabus besides the course title.
- On a day-to-day basis, teachers would remind students of what was due
  by the next class. Usually, these were readings. If I wasn't paying
  attention (a typical situation by the way---this isn't a /kids these
  days/ screed) I would look at the aforementioned course schedule,
  which was probably in my bedroom somewhere. If not, I imagine I found
  another copy. I don't remember how.
- Sometimes, the teacher would then hand out other sheets of paper
  called assignments. They would explain the assignments, and then
  students would go do them to the best of their ability, meeting with
  the teacher during their office hours as necessary.
- A grade was given at the end of the semester. Given that I never read
  a syllabus, the way these were calculated remains something of a
  mystery to me.

Essentially, the entire course was managed by teacher circulating
print-based documents in class. This was a highly imperfect system for
all sorts of reasons. But there are a few things it encouraged that were
highly positive: attending class, the value of listening (even though,
as mentioned, I often wasn't), personal organization, and in-person
interaction with a teacher.

I remember my first introduction to an LMS. A literature professor used
Blackboard (a popular LMS), which she correctly identified as the future
of education. She still circulated all the same documents, though, and I
tried my best to ignore Blackboard.

Eventually, we were required to take an in-class quiz using her LMS, and
I could ignore it no longer. We were told to bring a computer to class,
which seemed very dumb to me in the context of a literature course.
Wasn't it easier just to take the quiz on paper? Whatever. I opened up
the quiz on Blackboard and reviewed the questions. I was sitting at the
back of the room and looked up. What I saw was about 75% of students
cheating on the quiz.

*Dear Critical Reader:* I do not think all or most students, in general,
are cheating. I'll go even further and say that I think quizzes on
literary texts are, themselves, a largely unproductive genre. And if a
teacher is giving a quiz proctored through a networked computer,
honestly, whatever happens happens. That's on you.

It's just the case that almost everyone on that day was cheating. And it
set the tone---fairly or unfairly---for my view on these systems in
general. Learning management systems solve a lot of problems. And they
certainly enable important interactions for online classes. But for
in-person classes, they've fostered a "web-first" assumption on the part
of teachers /and/ students that, in the final account, bad.

It's bad because it affords new types of cheating, sure, but I don't
really care much about that. These systems are truly bad several other
reasons:

- *Reason 1.* They completely alter the relationship between teachers
  and students, putting an incredibly poorly designed technology between
  them and telling both parties that they "solve" the "problem" of
  course communication.
- *Reason 2:* They track everything students and teachers do on and with
  them. This is both a privacy issue and a labor issue.
- *Reason 3:* They tell their audiences that their primary purpose is
  *Reason 1* when it is actually *Reason 2*. *Reason 2* provides data
  that is given back to both universities and private companies, which
  they then use/sell to earn profits in ways that are not only unrelated
  to but often in opposition to teaching and learning.
- *Reason 4:* Students, when you ask them, don't even like these
  systems.
- *Reason 5:* The LMS are now /widely assumed to be the class itself,/
  not a tool used by a teacher within a larger class setting. This is
  demonstrated constantly by the language that surrounds them. Before
  the semester: "Do you have your class posted?" "Yeah I'm almost there.
  I just need to work on my classes a bit."

I've taken to call this LMS-assumption "content management pedagogy."
Content management, to be clear, is the productive and necessary
technical writing skill of managing and designing content for users.
Content management pedagogy is the typically unproductive and
less-necessary phenomenon where the processing and management of course
material becomes unconsciously synonymous with teaching and learning.
Content management pedagogy is evident when teachers are forced to spend
valuable time (that could be used to design learning activities, for
instance) updating overly complicated and borderline legalistic
documents across multiple sections of a single course. Content
management pedagogy accounts for the feeling that we're teaching online
courses when we're /in/ the classroom, opening online materials for
in-person students who all have computers or phones. Content management
pedagogy is what trains us all that a 20-email thread to *not* answer a
question is flexible, accommodating efficiency, while answering that
same question in four seconds in class is limiting.

The culprit here is, and never could be, students or teachers. It's that
technology changes the delivery of learning. It's the LMS. And it's bad.

One article?! Yes. And I am sorry. It's the first week of the semester,
and I've been working on a research project that's taken up a lot of my
independent reading/writing time. At the very least, I am also posting
an additional blog post I've been working on, which you can check out
[[/posts/2024/08/stay-on-the-bus-or-optimization-is-a-dirty-word/][here]].

As always, I generate summaries using AI and edit those summaries for
accuracy and usefulness. Then, I offer some thoughts of my own.

The article discusses the vulnerability of Europe's electricity grid due
to centralized, cloud-based management of millions of solar panels.
These systems, largely unregulated, could be hacked or malfunction,
leading to massive power disruptions. The author calls for stricter
regulation, treating these management platforms like energy companies
rather than just websites. Upcoming EU directives like NIS2 and the
Cyber Resilience Act could help address these issues, but immediate
action is needed to prevent potential grid failures.

Oddly enough, just this past week I was referring a friend to
[[https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262529969/a-prehistory-of-the-cloud/][Tung-Hui
Hu's /A Prehistory of the Cloud/]], which has a lot of parallel lines to
Hubert's article here. The article is centrally focused on the
Netherlands but (as Hubert notes) its themes and the problems it
identifies are certainly internationally concerning. In his
/Prehistory,/ Hu writes:

#+begin_quote
  as each infrastructure becomes naturalized, we tend to refer to it
  with increasing amounts of abstraction, talking about its use (cloud
  storage) rather than the infrastructure itself (storage servers in
  data centers). (xxvii)
#+end_quote

This "forgetting" of the material and geopolitical basis of our
technological lives, noted by both Hubert and Hu, is something we should
resist.

It will be *extraordinarily interesting* to see how this reshapes
conversations about AI. Personally, I'm really interested in how this
ease of access will alter conversations about these new tools in higher
education. I've already begun to adapt to these tools and integrate them
into my workflows (for quite a while now, actually), as have many folks
working in various writing professions, such as technical communication.
In my view, though, many academics in writing-related fields haven't
seriously engaged them. I'm looking forward to seeing how this continues
to develop in the Fall.

Similar to my comments above, I'm just struck by how accessible AI tools
are about to be for *everyone*, and how inextricable they will be from
other types of work. The line between work done with AI tools and work
done without AI tools will soon become meaningless, I think. Anyone in
knowledge work will need to embrace them and be conscious of both their
value and limitations. Ignoring them, though, is not a possibility.

Last night I watched two apocalyptic films. Both Nicholas Ashe Bateman's
/The Wanting Mare/ and Adam McKay's /Don't Look Up/ note that the world
seems to be moving toward catastrophe. While the /The Wanting Mare/
imagines an ambiguous future in a fantastical post-apocalyptic city,
/Don't Look Up/ satirically reflects our present world in the face of an
incoming comet--a perhaps too-on-the-nose "planet-killer." Neither film
is perfect, but each suggests a similar conclusion: in a senseless
world, codependence is the only way to find meaning.

/The Wanting Mare/ follows a multigenerational family of women who dream
of a world that existed before an unnamed apocalyptic event. Most of the
story takes place in a devastated city called Whithren where wild horses
are caught and exported to another city across the sea called Levithen.
Whithren is devastated, and much of the narrative centers on the curious
detail that is possible to acquire a one-way ticket to Levithen
alongside the horses on an export ship. These tickets are so rare that
the people of Whitren regularly kill and are killed for them.

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt Moira, one of the principal characters in The Wanting Mare.
[[file:catastrophe-films/moira.jpg]]

I'll avoid saying more and spoiling the plot. Described in quite a few
online reviews I read as a "tone poem," /The Wanting Mare/ excels in
/ambiance/. Its insistent and, at times, frustrating lack of both
dialogue and plot exposition makes it difficult to put it into words. (I
learned this in an earlier, much longer draft of this post, from which
I've spared you.)

Against the ambient and labyrinthine style of /The Wanting Mare/, the
aggressive satire in McKay's /Don't Look Up/ (which I watched
immediately after) gave me whiplash. I could practically hear the movie
saying:

{{< figure src="dicaprio.jpg" alt="Leonardo Dicaprio, in Don't Look Up,
yelling.">}}

#+begin_quote
  This comet is climate change! Stop ignoring it! Stop letting
  politicians ignore it!
#+end_quote

There's value to the political messaging in the movie and its critique
of modern life. And I share many of the perspectives offered in the
movie. But I can't help feeling oversells "how dumb everything is"
(think /Idiocracy,/
[[https://www.vice.com/en/article/bn3vgv/idiocracy-is-elitist-porn][which
is bad]]) over its more subtle themes. This is always the bargain
involved in turning politics into art, which more often enervates than
accelerates change, and most often has no effect at all.

What's more interesting about /Don't Look Up/ is that throughout nearly
the entire narrative the catastrophic event has not yet occurred. But it
feels so much more determined, so much more possible, than whatever it
is that actually, already destroyed the world in /The Wanting Mare/.
This is largely due to McKay's realism and the directness of the
commentary juxtaposed against the subtle, fantastical, elements
presented by Bateman. And McKay is right: it is difficult to argue
against the dire position we're in.

But Bateman's movie dares to hope and to find hope in human connections,
relationships, and histories. Which is not to say that McKay doesn't get
there as well. Anyone who has watched /Don't Look Up/ knows that there
is only one thing there before "the end." And if you've watched /The
Wanting Mare/ you hope they'll be there after, too.
