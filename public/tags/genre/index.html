    <h2><a href="/posts/2025/02/genres-normative-function/">Genreâ€™s Normative Function</a></h2>
    Brief and wandering thoughts on genre.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2024/11/link-roundup-november-4-2024/">Link Roundup: November 4, 2024</a></h2>
    Fritz Lang on his film M and a tutorial for HTML-based resumes.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2022/06/what-is-genre/">What is Genre?</a></h2>
    A concept that is has been popping up in recent posts is genre. It&rsquo;s not surprising, as genre is central not only to film&ndash;increasingly, the focus of this blog&ndash;but to rhetoric and writing studies, my academic home. But what <em>is</em> genre?
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2022/06/masculinity-in-shane-and-yojimbo/">Masculinity in Shane and Yojimbo</a></h2>
    I&rsquo;ve been going through some of my notes from a film genre class I took in graduate school. One week, we watched <em>Shane</em> and <em>Yojimbo</em> as cross-cultural examples of the western, which historically commingled with the samurai film in Japan.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2022/06/men-2022/">Men (2022)</a></h2>
    A few weeks ago, I went to see Alex Garland&rsquo;s film Men. I really enjoyed, especially in the context of my growing interest in both film genre studies and the specific genre of horror.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2021/06/satoyama-modernity-and-tradition-in-japanese-anime/">Satoyama, Modernity, and Tradition in Japanese Anime</a></h2>
    I&rsquo;ve been reading scholarship about anime, its history, and how it deviates from animation in the United States. It&rsquo;s frequently observed that tensions between tradition and modernity are often central to anime.
