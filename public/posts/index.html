    <h2><a href="/posts/2024/04/bulang-huang-chen-hao-2018/">Bulang Huang Chen Hao (2018)</a></h2>
    Liquid Proust
Drank on April 3, rainy day evening session.
The leaves broke up really nice.
I used 10 grams in 100 ml gaiwan to use up some remaining leaves in the sample. Flash steeps.
Young puer sour smell on the wet leaves.
Tasted somewhere between a slightly aged and young puer. Could taste the &ldquo;grandma&rsquo;s house&rdquo; notes behind the astringency, similar to Love Forever.
Not too think and not too light of a mouthfeel.

    <h2><a href="/posts/2022/12/covid-day-four/">Covid - Day Four</a></h2>
    Today will be a shorter post. Rather than write, I spent most of the day a) submitting grades and b) working on a new track.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2022/12/covid-day-three/">Covid - Day Three</a></h2>
    Day three has been alright so far. Last night, again, my only issue sleeping was my wrecked throat. A bought me some chloraseptic today; I imagine that will help tonight.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2022/12/covid-day-two/">Covid - Day Two</a></h2>
    My second day of Covid. The good news-A tested this morning and so far continues to come up negative. The bad news-I feel like butt.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2022/12/covid-day-one/">Covid - Day One</a></h2>
    I made it several years into the Covid-19 pandemic without catching the virus. Unfortunately, my time has come.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2022/06/what-is-genre/">What is Genre?</a></h2>
    A concept that is has been popping up in recent posts is genre. It&rsquo;s not surprising, as genre is central not only to film&ndash;increasingly, the focus of this blog&ndash;but to rhetoric and writing studies, my academic home. But what <em>is</em> genre?
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2022/06/superheroes-ritual-or-ideology/">Superheroes: Ritual or Ideology?</a></h2>
    I read something fascinating in Rick Altman&rsquo;s book that I discussed in <a href="/film/men/">another recent post</a>. He talked about two ways that critics tend to look at film&rsquo;s social dimension. These are as ritual or as ideology.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2022/06/masculinity-in-shane-and-yojimbo/">Masculinity in Shane and Yojimbo</a></h2>
    I&rsquo;ve been going through some of my notes from a film genre class I took in graduate school. One week, we watched <em>Shane</em> and <em>Yojimbo</em> as cross-cultural examples of the western, which historically commingled with the samurai film in Japan.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2022/06/men-2022/">Men (2022)</a></h2>
    A few weeks ago, I went to see Alex Garland&rsquo;s film Men. I really enjoyed, especially in the context of my growing interest in both film genre studies and the specific genre of horror.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2022/01/two-films-on-catastrophe/">Two Films on Catastrophe</a></h2>
    Last night I watched Nicholas Ashe Bateman&rsquo;s The Wanting Mare and Adam McKay&rsquo;s Don&rsquo;t Look Up. Each suggests a similar conclusion-in a senseless world, codependence is the only way to find meaning.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2021/11/memory-document-archive/">Memory, Document, Archive</a></h2>
    By collecting and categorizing historical artifacts, archives deeply influence the historical record. But they exist in complicated institutional settings, and archivists can&rsquo;t always have full control over how their archives present history. Researchers have to consider the archive less as a neutral place and more as a  motivated and rhetorical construction.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2021/11/what-is-new-about-new-media/">What is New About New Media?</a></h2>
    New media are better defined as media that challenge our existing conceptions of technology&hellip; even if the new media in question might be old.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2021/06/satoyama-modernity-and-tradition-in-japanese-anime/">Satoyama, Modernity, and Tradition in Japanese Anime</a></h2>
    I&rsquo;ve been reading scholarship about anime, its history, and how it deviates from animation in the United States. It&rsquo;s frequently observed that tensions between tradition and modernity are often central to anime.
