      <p>Sadly, I have been too busy this past week to read much for the link
roundup and, sadly, that will continue today. So, instead of a set of
links, I figured I&rsquo;d take this brief blogging time to share some
thoughts on books I&rsquo;ve read so far this year that I&rsquo;ve enjoyed.</p>
<p>Due to the aforementioned time restriction, don&rsquo;t think of these as full
reviews or full considerations. Several of these books are on my list to
eventually write full posts or even articles about. I&rsquo;ll just share one
or two quick thoughts from each. Their inclusion on this list, itself,
signals my strong recommendation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confucius, <em>The Analects.</em></strong> I&rsquo;ve read Confucius several times before,
but given that I am teaching his ideas in my global rhetorics-based
writing courses, I decided to do a reread of <em>The Analects</em> toward the
beginning of the year. I&rsquo;m about five years back into a formal Zen
practice, and the cross-contamination between Confucian thought and
Zen Buddhism was evident in this read. Despite certain overly
traditionalist and patriarchal elements of Confucian thought, which
need to be put aside, I really do appreciate the model of the &ldquo;good&rdquo;
that <em>The Analects</em> offers.</li>
<li><strong>Brian Hodge, <em>I&rsquo;ll Bring You the Birds from Out of the Sky.</em></strong> This
was just an absolutely stunning cosmic horror novella. The dread of
certain passages has stuck with me for months, and given that my wife
is West Virginian the location was especially intriguing.</li>
<li><strong>Han Kang, <em>The Vegetarian.</em></strong> I don&rsquo;t even know what to say about this
novel. Most novel readers are aware of it by now but, if you aren&rsquo;t,
it&rsquo;s an incredibly haunting text told in three parts about the
dissolution of a Korean family when a woman bucks social norms by
becoming a vegetarian. The story itself, oddly, has very little to do
with vegetarianism and more to do with gender roles, patriarchy, and
social punishment. But those are incomplete thoughts; I&rsquo;m still
processing this one.</li>
<li><strong>Andrew Culp, <em>Dark Deleuze.</em></strong> Culp argues that academics have
shockingly (note my sarcasm) deradicalized Deleuze&rsquo;s thought. Deleuze
is my favorite philosopher, or at least the one most influential to my
general worldview, and I&rsquo;ve had Culp&rsquo;s book on my reading list for
quite a while. It&rsquo;s an odd read for me because I agree wholeheartedly
with Culp&rsquo;s larger points and don&rsquo;t always appreciate his smaller ones
in the construction of the argument. The book would be of negative
interest to anyone not invested in Deleuze, but it&rsquo;s highly worth a
read for anyone who is.</li>
<li><strong>Sarah Manguso, <em>Ongoingness: The End of a Diary.</em></strong> Sarah Manguso is
my favorite living writer. Her book <em>Siste Viator</em> was probably the
most influential text in getting me to care about language in my
freshman year of college, and everything I&rsquo;ve read by her has left a
mark. This book focuses on the author&rsquo;s archival obsession and her
process of releasing it. I don&rsquo;t want to say too much more yet, as I&rsquo;m
already working my thoughts into a larger piece, but I can say with
certainty that this is my favorite book I&rsquo;ve read so far, this year.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, there are some thoughts. Apologies for not having more, but teaching
calls.</p>
