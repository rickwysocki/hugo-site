      <p>It&rsquo;s honestly sort of comical that I&rsquo;m including these two articles in
the same link roundup. They reflect the extreme polarities of my
interests. The first is a 1998 interview with Paul Virilio, a theorist
of media and technology with extraordinary skepticism about the logics
and effects of technical progress. The second is a blog post about ways
to make better decisions. Ultimately, I&rsquo;m just a guy with very wide
reading interests who is also trying to get stuff done. Like I said,
these articles reflect that.</p>
<p>As always, I generate summaries using AI and edit those summaries for
accuracy and usefulness. Then, I offer some thoughts of my own.</p>

</h3>
<p>In this interview, Paul Virilio discusses the evolving nature of
accidents in modern society. He differentiates between localized,
industrial accidents of the past and the emerging &ldquo;integral accident&rdquo; of
the digital age, which is global and systemic. Virilio argues that while
traditional accidents could be contained, modern accidents are pervasive
and interconnected, challenging our ability to control them. He views
accidents as an inevitable part of technological progress and warns that
we must learn to live with these risks rather than seek to eliminate
them.</p>

<p>It is heartening to me that, given the topic and Virilio&rsquo;s general
stance toward technology, the initial summary ChatGPT generated for the
interview was absolutely terrible. It is pretty much unquestionable that
Virilio would have nothing but disdain for ChatGPT. What is more
interesting to me, though, is how this interview from 1998 gives a sense
of his orientation toward progress more succinctly than his writing. He
begins by outlining the historical progression from the localized
technical accident (e.g., a train crash) toward the integral, global
accident that implicates all of us (e.g., the effects of network
technology on the environment). What is fascinating, though, is his
insistence that the goal is not to reject technological &ldquo;progress&rdquo; but
to wrestle with it, to face it directly. That&rsquo;s something that hasn&rsquo;t
come across quite as clearly in work I&rsquo;ve read from Virilio, so I
appreciated this interview.</p>
<p>Beyond his insights, there are several nostalgia-inducing moments here
from 1998, such as anxiety about the Millenium Bug and references to
Napster. Those, alone, make it worth reading.</p>

<p>This article discusses strategies for improving decision-making by
writing down your thought process, prioritizing evaluation criteria,
sharing decisions with others for feedback, reflecting on past
decisions, and learning through deliberate practice, such as playing
poker. Stoiber also provides a decision log template to help structure
and refine decision-making. These practices aim to enhance clarity,
speed, and accuracy in both personal and professional contexts.</p>

<p>Much of the value of this post comes from Stoiber&rsquo;s decision log
template toward the end of the article. I think there&rsquo;s a lot of benefit
in finding ways to make your thinking material and explicit. Personally,
I use a variety of techniques for this, such as the GTD system for task
management and a zettelkasten for writing. I think Stoiber&rsquo;s heuristic
for decision-making is worth giving a shot.</p>
