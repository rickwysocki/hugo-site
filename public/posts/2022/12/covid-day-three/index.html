  <p>I do hope that these posts don&rsquo;t communicate: &ldquo;pity me!&rdquo; With the devastation that Covid has brought on folks and families, I&rsquo;m incredibly lucky to have gotten it a) this late and b) so fully vaccinated. Please know that these posts are more of a personal timestamp than anything meant to be read.</p>
<p>Day three has been alright so far. Last night, again, my only issue sleeping was my wrecked throat. A bought me some chloraseptic today; I imagine that will help tonight.</p>
<p>The NyQuil I took last night gave me some very strange dreams. One of them included a visit to my Zen center that involved a buffet of beef brisket. (In the waking world, the Zen center only serves vegetarian food.) In the dream, I took too much food and robbed everyone else of a meal. (Hungry ghosts come to mind.) Then I somehow showed up late to the sitting portion of the retreat. When I got there, there were hundreds of unfamiliar people doing walking meditation and reciting an unfamiliar chant. Weird stuff.</p>
<p>I finished responding to students&rsquo; work today. Feeling a bit loopy from DayQuil, I decided to push the actual submission of grades until tomorrow morning. After that, this semester will be a wrap.</p>
<p>Last night, I started reading William Gibson&rsquo;s <em>Neuromancer</em>, a novel I certainly should have already read. I&rsquo;m enjoying it so far. I also watched <em>The Thirteenth Floor</em>, a remake of Fassbender&rsquo;s <em>World on a Wire.</em> It didn&rsquo;t have the same charm.</p>
<p>While still fairly bored, I&rsquo;ve grown oddly accustomed to this room. A still tests negative, which is great.</p>
<p>Coughing manageably,</p>
<p>Rick</p>
