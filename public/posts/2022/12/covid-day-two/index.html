  <h1>Covid - Day Two</h1>

  
  
  <time datetime="2022-12-16T16:08:22-05:00">December 16, 2022</time>

  <p>My second day of Covid. The good news: A tested this morning and so far continues to come up negative. The bad news: I feel like butt.</p>
<p>I was happily able to get a fair amount of sleep last night. It was only my absolutely scorched throat that woke me a few times. Today, though, my symptoms have gotten quite a bit worse. I still feel within the realm of &ldquo;really bad cold / flu,&rdquo; but it is not fun.</p>
<p>The worst part, though expected, is that I lost my senses of smell and taste today. It&rsquo;s quite odd to smell and taste a jar of peanut butter, one minute, and then only minutes later find it, or yourself, lifeless in flavor and fragrance.</p>
<p>Just to be sure, I took the nuclear option and squirted a bunch of hand sanitizer onto my palm. Taking a big huff (no, I didn&rsquo;t taste it) burned my nostrils. But, if asked, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to tell what caused the pain if it wasn&rsquo;t myself that concocted this weird test. I don&rsquo;t recommend it.</p>
<p>I made some solid efforts toward responding to students&rsquo; papers. In an ideal situation, I&rsquo;ll be done with the fall semester tomorrow. In a realistic one, it will probably be Sunday.</p>
<p>Before bed last night, I watched <em>Rambo</em>. Not having seen a Rambo film since I was a young kid, I expected it to be a shoot-em-up action film. It was. It also wasn&rsquo;t. Maybe I&rsquo;ll write up more thoughts at another time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting quite bored. After this, I&rsquo;ll sit zazen for a bit. Then maybe watch a movie.</p>
<p>With phlegm,</p>
<p>Rick</p>
