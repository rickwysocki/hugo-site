  <p>Well. I made it several years into the Covid-19 pandemic without catching the virus. Unfortunately, my time has come.</p>
<p>Having a mildly sore throat and a small cough, I thought I&rsquo;d gotten a small common cold. It was the first time I&rsquo;d been sick, at all, during the pandemic, so even this small slight to my health seemed greatly annoying.</p>
<p>I figured I should take a test anyway and, lo and behold: Covid-19. I could swear those pink and blue lines were on the test strip before I even dunked it in the fluid.</p>
<p>There are a few &ldquo;silver linings&rdquo; so far. First, my fianc√© tested negative. I&rsquo;m writing this quarantined in my home office with an air mattress and some other comforting items. These include my gaiwan and pu&rsquo;erh tea, my Kindle, and my zazen cushion. My only goal at this point is to hopefully avoid spreading it to A.</p>
<p>Second, both A and I are vaccinated and boosted.</p>
<p>Third, while I definitely feel sick, the symptoms have been fairly manageable so far. My cough and sore throat <em>have</em> gotten worse. But not much worse. And while I&rsquo;ve certainly felt feverish and ache-y throughout the day, it&rsquo;s been relatively mild, all things considered.</p>
<p>I figure: why not document my time with Covid-19? Just post a couple of notes each day with how I&rsquo;m feeling and what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>
<p>A few things I&rsquo;d like to achieve while I&rsquo;m stuck in this room for the time being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish responding to student projects and submit grades. That&rsquo;s right; I got Covid during the week of final grade submission.</li>
<li>Do one or two mini / solo zazen retreats.</li>
<li>Read a book or two. I actually just finished one.</li>
<li>Watch some movies.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now.</p>
<p>In sick solidarity,</p>
<p>Rick</p>
