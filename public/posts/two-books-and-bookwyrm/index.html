      <p>The semester continues, the news rages on, and the world gets worse. The
latter two items aren&rsquo;t related to the first, except that they all are
reasons I won&rsquo;t have a fully featured link roundup this week. I&rsquo;ve just
been swamped with teaching, feelings, and also with continuing to work
on a research project that&rsquo;s been on my mind&hellip; forever. More on that if
I ever get to a full manuscript.</p>
<p>So, what I&rsquo;ll offer instead is a few book reviews. I&rsquo;ve decided to
finally leave Goodreads, and will now be posting my short reviews on the
decentralized alternative Bookwyrm.

<h2 class="heading" id="percival-everett-james">
  Percival Everett, <em>James</em>
  <a class="anchor" href="#percival-everett-james">#</a>
</h2>
<p>This novel, focused on the practice and clearly the legacy of slavery in
the United States, is both amazing and harrowing. The only book that
comes to mind to associate the feeling of reading <em>James</em> is Toni
Morrison&rsquo;s <em>Beloved</em>, which shook me in a similar fashion despite having
a completely different approach to the topic.</p>
<p>In <em>James</em>, Everett reclaims the character Jim from <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>,
re-telling the story from his perspective. I hadn&rsquo;t read <em>Huckleberry
Finn</em> since I was a kid, and truthfully I appreciated not having re-read
it before jumping into Everett&rsquo;s reclamation. There is just so much to
think about in <em>James</em> as a standalone novel, from the commentary on
marginalized language practices, to the abominable history of slavery,
to the subtle indication that the character James wrote the the actual
book held by the reader. I strongly recommend this one.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="rita-bullwinkel-headshot">
  Rita Bullwinkel, <em>Headshot</em>
  <a class="anchor" href="#rita-bullwinkel-headshot">#</a>
</h2>
<p>This book was really engaging in terms form, but it didn&rsquo;t captivate me
much in terms of content. I think the project of a cross-temporal novel
told totally through interiority is interesting, but as strange as it
sounds I came away feeling like I still didn&rsquo;t really know the
characters. I wondered at times if it was simply my not having the
experience of girlhood (which is the organizing theme of the book), and
I do think that&rsquo;s likely the main issue. So whatever qualms I have about
the book (and, again, I think it&rsquo;s extraordinarily unique and
fascinating) have more to do with me than anything else.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="kurt-vonnegut-breakfast-of-champions">
  Kurt Vonnegut, <em>Breakfast of Champions</em>
  <a class="anchor" href="#kurt-vonnegut-breakfast-of-champions">#</a>
</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to say something bordering on sacrilege for a book-person
sitting in Indiana: I did not like this at all. The last 20-30 pages
were an incredible (short) book and admittedly brought the slog through
the preceding 270 into focus. And I&rsquo;m open to Vonnegut&rsquo;s project of
&ldquo;total life through art&rdquo; and his critique of narrative reality.</p>
<p>But, man, this book was tedious. And while it&rsquo;s clear that Vonnegut was
depicting racism, sexism, and homophobia in order to condemn them, he
just wasn&rsquo;t landing the tricks.</p>
