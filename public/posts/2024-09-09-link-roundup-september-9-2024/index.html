</h3>
<p>Oscar Schwartz&rsquo;s article &ldquo;Against Rereading&rdquo; reflects on the tension
between the profound, transformative experience of reading a book for
the first time and the widely celebrated practice of rereading. While
literary greats like Nabokov and Barthes advocate for rereading as a way
to deepen understanding and even produce new meanings, Schwartz remains
skeptical. He argues that the magic of first reading is rooted in its
immediacy, intensity, and emotional resonance, which subsequent readings
might erode. Ultimately, Schwartz suggests that rereading can be a
conservative act, tied to tradition, and at odds with the fleeting, yet
enriching, experience of encountering a text for the first time.</p>

<p>I am a chronic repeater. In large part, this is a symptom of being, for
lack of a better term, a control freak. I remember once reading that
Immanuel Kant lived each of his days <em>exactly</em> the same, down to his
walking patterns in his house, and that this disciplined existence is
associated with his extremely influential philosophical output. This was
in college, and I decided that was how I wanted to live (what the fuck)
and made myself a rigid schedule where every moment of my time was
accounted for. My friend looked at the schedule and asked when I would
have time to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>I still fetishize the idea of that sort of life but have come to accept
that it is impossible. The paradox, however, is that I have always been
convinced that rereading, or re-consuming (TV shows, films, etc.), the
same texts is generally inferior to reading as diversely and widely as
one possibly can. This, again, is a reaction to my tendency to read and
watch the same things over and over again when left to my own devices.</p>
<p>With that in mind, this article really resonated with me. I am persuaded
both by Schwartz&rsquo;s argument against the unquestioned supremacy of
rereading. I am also very impressed by the depth with which he explores
the argument in favor of rereading, as well. Ultimately, the following
passage reflects my own attitude:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the end, maybe the crucial difference between those who read once
and those who reread is an attitude toward time, or more precisely,
death. The most obvious argument against rereading is, of course, that
there just isn&rsquo;t enough time. It makes no sense to luxuriate in
Flaubert&rsquo;s physiognomic details over and over again, unless you think
you&rsquo;re going to live forever. For those who do not reread, a book is
like a little life. When it ends, it dies&mdash;or it lives on,
imperfectly and embellished, in your memories. There is a sense of
loss in this death, but also pleasure. Or as the French might put it,
la petite mort.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m a control freak.</p>

</h3>
<p>The article discusses an experiment by a writer hired to produce a
200-word article about a new coffee shop. After completing the task, the
writer wondered if AI tools like ChatGPT could deliver a similar
product. To test this, the writer entered the same press release into
ChatGPT and compared the AI-generated copy to their own work. ChatGPT&rsquo;s
output was slick but filled with clichés and lacked meaningful content
or human appeal. The key critique was that while ChatGPT can generate
grammatically correct and polished text, it struggles to understand what
engages readers on a human level​.</p>

<p>A nice, short, and shareable article on why ChatGPT <strong>cannot</strong> replace
writing. I like its emphasis on how context and meaning can be so easily
lost in generated text. I maintain that generative AI can be useful as a
tool (see these link roundups, of course) but not as a replacement for
writing. Writing, after all, is definitionally a form of human thinking.</p>

</h3>
<p>Benedict Evans&rsquo;s article discusses how technological predictions often
ask the wrong questions. He illustrates this with examples of forecasts
from the mid-20th century that missed key developments, like the
internet, focusing instead on less relevant issues. Evans emphasizes
that predicting future tech trends involves more than guessing
advancements&mdash;it requires understanding underlying platforms and
frameworks. He also reflects on the importance of questioning
assumptions about what comes next in technology and the potential for
unforeseen breakthroughs.</p>

<p>When I was a youthful undergraduate scholar I was afforded the
opportunity to attend an academic conference for honors students across
universities. I only remember a few moments from it, but one of them
comes back to me with surprising frequency. I would guess that I
think about it a few times a month.</p>
<p>Another honors student was giving a presentation on science fiction and
its social commentary. It was, even for an undergraduate honors student
discussing science fiction at a conference, incredibly
techno-optimistic. His essential point was that we can look to histories
of science fiction to historicize our understandings of technology in
the present. I was too shy during the Q&amp;A, but afterward I approached
him and asked (some version of): &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a possibility that science
fiction could <em>normalize</em> understandings of technology? And couldn&rsquo;t
those normalizations be harmful, wrong, or a combination of both?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s
hard to capture this and difficult to not sound like I am overstating,
but the presenter&rsquo;s response seemed extraordinarily similar to what I
imagine it would look like if I had asked a question in a foreign
language. For him, science fiction simply charted how technological
progress &ldquo;actually is.&rdquo; And technological progress, of course, is good.
Keep in mind that this was probably 2011-2012, a time period of
<strong>enormous</strong> techno-optimism. These years and the ones immediately
following were sort of the inverse of the &ldquo;shot, chaser&rdquo; adage. <em>Look at
all of these wonderful new ways to participate in society.</em> (Chaser.)
<em>Look at what people, largely, are choosing to do with that&hellip;</em> (The
most disgusting shot imaginable.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m rambling. My loose point is that this story resonates with what
Evans is talking about here. I may be picking on the student, but truthfull we <strong>all</strong>
extrapolate current visions of technology into the future in one way or
another. I&rsquo;m persuaded by Evans&rsquo;s call to consider the unasked questions
when we do so.</p>
