<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>A few months ago, I got tired of dealing with my Jekyll site. That site was hosted on GitHub pages and used the Minimal Mistakes theme, which I continue to love. My issue, though, was that using a remote theme that I didn&rsquo;t quite understand led to ongoing difficulties with deployment. These, of course, all stemmed from user error.</p>
<p>Frustrated again by a site that wouldn&rsquo;t build or deploy, I said: &ldquo;Screw it. I&rsquo;m going to readymade option.&rdquo; I chose Ghost.</p>
<p>This platform seemed to have a lot of value:</p>
<ul>
<li>It seemed oriented toward writing and content over anything else.</li>
<li>There are a lot of cool analytics features within the platform.</li>
<li>It worked.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was unable to stick with Ghost.</p>
<p>The site worked, for sure. But it didn&rsquo;t give me the kind of granular control over content that I wanted. Worse, it didn&rsquo;t let me me <em>tinker</em>, which is the most important feature of a technology, to me.</p>
<p>So, I decided to learn how to create a Hugo site, from scratch.</p>
<h2 id="prior-knowledge">Prior Knowledge</h2>
<p>I went into this project knowing essentially nothing except about Hugo except its branded tagline: &ldquo;A content manager&rsquo;s dream.&rdquo; That was enough to hook me in. Sure, I&rsquo;ve had tons of experience with HTML, CSS/SCSS, and the relevant languages and markup syntax involved in Jekyll, like Liquid and Ruby. But I had no experience with Go, the language on which Hugo is based, or any of the other relevant aspects of the Hugo framework.</p>
<h2 id="current-knowledge">Current Knowledge</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taught myself&hellip; a lot. Over the past several weeks, I&rsquo;ve gone from knowing nothing to having built a pretty much fully functional Hugo site. It may not look like much, currently being pretty &ldquo;Bootstrap-y,&rdquo; but there&rsquo;s plenty of time to figure that out on a rolling basis.</p>
<p>Here is a list of things I&rsquo;ve learned and / or built into this site during this process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pretty much all of the methods of image processing available in Hugo. I put this first because it was probably the most difficult aspect of the project, requiring the most head-scratching and figuring out how Go works as a language. All of the images across the site are sized automatically to increase page-load time. That&rsquo;s pretty cool.</li>
<li>Lots (lots!) about SEO and what to include as far as metadata goes. I knew a fair amount about this, but Minimal Mistakes did a lot of things automatically that I didn&rsquo;t understand and had to learn.</li>
<li>Foregrounding site and page parameters to follow DRY principles as much as I possibly could. My plan is to release the final version of this theme as a project on GitHub, so I&rsquo;ve designed this version to be as modular, customizable, and user-oriented as possible. More can and will be done here, but I&rsquo;m happy with it so far.</li>
<li>Lots about Hugo shortcodes. One of my bugbears is writing accessible-first markup, as it should be for everyone. It was harder than I thought to create the ability to auto-resize image&ndash;which requires accessing them as as global or page resources&ndash;and also pass in thinks like alt-text and, as necessary, captions. So, I wrote some shortcodes that do just that. There are others that are less impressive but still useful. I&rsquo;ll detail those at a later time.</li>
<li>While I&rsquo;ve used Bootstrap many times in the past, I&rsquo;ve never done so using NPM. I wanted a deeper level of customizability (you probably can&rsquo;t currently tell, to be fair), so I learned how to use the NPM version of Bootstrap.</li>
<li>Finally, I&rsquo;ve just spent a lot of time messing around with the Hugo way of managing content. There&rsquo;s a lot more to come in that regard (see below), but I&rsquo;ve learned a lot and am loving it so far.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>While I&rsquo;m happy with all the work I&rsquo;ve done here, there are quite a few things I want to get squared away. Here&rsquo;s a list of what&rsquo;s to come.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The visual design.</strong> I know it, you know it; this site looks very boring. A next move will be focusing on a visual redesign of some of what I have here so far.</li>
<li><strong>Bringing in more content.</strong> I&rsquo;m planning to bring in old posts and resources, but relatively slowly. The reason is that I want to be exactingly intentional about how I create the content structure for what I have here.</li>
<li><strong>Release the theme.</strong> The nice thing is that I&rsquo;m really not all that far away from this. I&rsquo;ll probably send something up to GitHub once I figure out the visual redesign.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fun stuff! I&rsquo;ve learned so much building this site and developed a lot of useful new skills.</p>
