  Optimal, Optimize, Optimization: Definitions and Parts of Speech
  <a class="anchor" href="#optimal-optimize-optimization-definitions-and-parts-of-speech">#</a>
</h2>
<p>I want to start this post with three definitions from the Oxford
Dictionary. They&rsquo;re related, but I want to show you that they are very
different in practice.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimal</strong>: Best, most favourable, esp. under a particular set of
circumstances.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize</strong>: To render optimal, to make as good as possible; to make
the best or most effective use of.</li>
<li><strong>Optimization</strong>: The action or process of making the best of something;
(also) the action or process of rendering optimal; the state or
condition of being optimal.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m a writer and professor, so you&rsquo;ll need to indulge me in this next
part. Look at the part of speech each word occupies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimal is a noun.</strong> It simply <strong>is</strong> the favorable condition and it
exists (as the definition indicates) in a specific context.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize is a verb.</strong> It is a <strong>process</strong>. Like all verbs and
processes, in English at least, it is implied that it can take place
and still fail to meet necessary conditions. We can write&hellip; and fail to meet our word count. We
can give a speech&hellip; and fail to persuade our audience. And we can optimize&hellip; and fail to do anything, really, at all.</li>
<li><strong>Optimization is a nominalization.</strong> A nominalization occurs when
we turn a verb into a noun. Notice that nominalizing &ldquo;optimize&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t just return us to &ldquo;optimal,&rdquo; the noun that the verb &ldquo;optimize&rdquo; ostensibly guides us toward. What this suggests, I want to argue, is that optimal and optimization, while similar at first glance, point to very different things and, often, are at odds.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading" id="the-problem-with-nominalizations">
  The Problem with Nominalizations
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-problem-with-nominalizations">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Nominalization is well known among writers as, at least, a potentially
problematic tendency. In technical writing, nominalizations are known to
be, well, annoying and confusing.
<a href="https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/words/avoid-hidden-verbs/#:~:text=What%20are%20hidden%20verbs%3F">PlainLanguage.gov</a>
offers several examples, but here&rsquo;s one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nominalization: If you cannot <strong>make the payment</strong> of the $100 fee,
you must <strong>make an application</strong> in writing before you file your tax
return.</li>
<li>Corrected: If you cannot <strong>pay</strong> the $100 fee, you must <strong>apply</strong>
in writing before you file your tax return.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear when you look at the examples side by side. Keeping &ldquo;pay&rdquo; and
&ldquo;apply&rdquo; as verbs simplifies things and ensures the sentence is clear and
direct.</p>
<p>Okay, this first example may seem like a small deal to non-technical
writers. (It&rsquo;s not, by the way.) But there are other reasons to be
skeptical of nominalizations. <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/the-dark-side-of-verbs-as-nouns/">Henry Hitchings
writes</a>
that while nominalizations aren&rsquo;t bad by nature, they can certainly
serve unethical purposes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nominalizations give priority to actions rather than to the people responsible for them. Sometimes this is apt, perhaps because we don&rsquo;t know who is responsible or because responsibility isn&rsquo;t relevant. But often they conceal power relationships and reduce our sense of what&rsquo;s truly involved in a transaction. As such, they are an instrument of manipulation, in politics and in business. They emphasize products and results, rather than the processes by which products and results are achieved.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hitchings is pointing out an insight familiar to rhetoricians: passive
language conceals the subject and context of the action.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="optimal-and-optimization-contradictory-tendencies">
  Optimal and Optimization: Contradictory Tendencies
  <a class="anchor" href="#optimal-and-optimization-contradictory-tendencies">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Here is one last piece of context before getting to my main point. While
thinking about this post, I grew curious about the use of optimal,
optimize, and optimization over time. My curiosity led me to plug the
terms into the <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/">Google Books Ngram Viewer</a>, which tracks the frequency of
search terms in printed sources published between 1500 and 2019 within a
particular set of languages. What I found speaks (metaphorically) to the
claim I want to present.</p>
<figure><a href="n-gram.jpg"><img src="/posts/2024-08-19-staying-on-the-bus/n-gram.jpg"
    alt="A Google NGram line-chart showing that the use of optimize and optimization grow while the term optimal declines, beginning slight after the year 2000."></a><figcaption>
      <p>Optimal, optimize, and optimization over time. (Click to enlarge.)</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Note how, beginning around the Internet era, the use of &ldquo;optimal&rdquo;
declined while &ldquo;optimize&rdquo; and &ldquo;optimization&rdquo; increased. There are plenty
of possible explanations for this, the most obvious one being benign
changes in language patterns. This is why I want to stress that I&rsquo;m
making a metaphorical association here, not a causal or a scientific
one.</p>
<p>Still, though, the Ngram does speak to my larger point:
the <strong>actual condition</strong> of being optimal doesn&rsquo;t necessarily correlate
to the action of optimizing nor to pursuing optimizations. In fact, these words highlight conflicting goals.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="optimization-eats-goals">
  Optimization Eats Goals
  <a class="anchor" href="#optimization-eats-goals">#</a>
</h2>
<p>When we pursue goals, we often take any
optimization as an assumed good. That&rsquo;s understandable to a degree. We
all have limited time and resources to pursue our aims. But my
experience is that a focus on optimization is nearly never helpful.
Sometimes, the <em>optimization state</em>&ndash;the mindset where we focus on
optimizing the process rather than pursuing the goal&mdash;clouds our
ability to <strong>even get started.</strong> If you start thinking about this,
examples from all areas of life are readily available:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The optimization state:</em> I need to figure out the optimal fitness
plan before beginning to work out. <em>The result</em>: Not getting
started.</li>
<li><em>The optimization state:</em> I need to draft the optimal outline or
take the optimal notes before I can write a word on the page. <em>The
result</em>: Not getting started.</li>
<li><em>The optimization state:</em> I need to research the optimal workflow
for collecting research articles before I begin to read. <em>The
result:</em> Not getting started.</li>
<li><em>The optimization state:</em> I need to decide on the optimal breathwork
technique before beginning a mindfulness practice. <em>The result:</em> Not
getting started.</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are other ways that the pursuit of optimization can hinder our
goals beyond just deferring our ability to get started. Often, pursuing
optimization simply runs us in circles.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="optimization-means-getting-off-the-bus">
  Optimization Means &ldquo;Getting off the Bus&rdquo;
  <a class="anchor" href="#optimization-means-getting-off-the-bus">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In <em>4000 Weeks: Time Management for Mortals</em>, Oliver Burkeman discusses
the concept of &ldquo;staying on the bus&rdquo; as a metaphor for a subtle way we
undercut ourselves in the pursuit of our goals. Here is the metaphor.
You decide you want to go somewhere. This &ldquo;somewhere&rdquo; is your unique
goal, what you want to accomplish. You decide to take a bus to your
&ldquo;somewhere.&rdquo; Eventually, you begin questioning your choice: was this the
right bus to take? Will this take me somewhere I want to go? Finally,
you cave and get off at the next stop. You walk back to where you
started and try taking another bus. Most likely, you then have the same
worry and repeat the same process. You waste time over and over when, if
you had simply stayed on the bus, you might have made it &ldquo;somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burkeman uses this metaphor to point out that we often &ldquo;get off the bus&rdquo;
when our creative work is unoriginal. Instead, he argues, we become
original by &ldquo;staying on the bus&rdquo; until our unoriginal work transforms
into something unique. But this metaphor applies to <strong>so many other
endeavors</strong>. Just take the list above:</p>
<ul>
<li>I decide that the fitness plan I have been following isn&rsquo;t moving me
toward the results I want quickly enough. I see another plan I could
follow, an <strong>optimization</strong>. I quit what I&rsquo;m doing to start an
entirely different plan at the beginning. <em>I&rsquo;ve gotten off the bus.</em></li>
<li>I decide that there is an <strong>optimization</strong> I could apply to my notes
or outlines that could be made after I read about another method
online. I spend a month reformatting all my notes rather than
writing/studying. <em>I&rsquo;ve gotten off the bus.</em></li>
<li>A cool, new citation manager affords <strong>optimizations</strong> for
collecting my research. I spend a month moving my library and, most
likely, paying a new subscription fee rather than reading. <em>I&rsquo;ve
gotten off the bus.</em></li>
<li>I spend four years meditating by counting my breath but see an
online figure cite mantra work as an <strong>optimization</strong> for practice.
I restart my practice. <em>I&rsquo;ve gotten off the bus.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In each of these scenarios, I hope it&rsquo;s becoming clear that worrying
about optimization is&hellip; pretty non-optimal. It&rsquo;s forcing us off the
bus, to continue to restart our efforts and feel &ldquo;productive&rdquo; when, in
actuality, optimization alone never gets us anywhere.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="getting-to-optimal-means-staying-on-the-bus">
  Getting to Optimal Means &ldquo;Staying on the Bus&rdquo;
  <a class="anchor" href="#getting-to-optimal-means-staying-on-the-bus">#</a>
</h2>
<p>To pull these threads together, the optimization state messes up the
context of our activity in the same way as nominalizations more
generally. While there are certainly times to <a href="https://learnhowtolearn.org/how-to-build-extremely-quickly/">reconsider fundamental
assumptions and to alter our
workflows</a>,
for many this can become a habit of distraction with the <em>appearance</em> of
being productive. Rather than progressing toward the condition that
&ldquo;optimal&rdquo; describes, we get caught in the feedback loop of the
optimization state. <strong>We start to see optimization, itself, as the goal.</strong></p>
<p>Hitchings pointed out above that nominalizations can be a tool of
manipulation. Likewise, we manipulate ourselves when we obsessively look
for &ldquo;optimizations&rdquo; for our workflows. This tendency too often stands in
place of optimal. Stay on the bus.</p>
