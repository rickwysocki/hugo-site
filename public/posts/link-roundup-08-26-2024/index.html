      <p>This week, I write about some articles full of (smart, correct)
technical skepticism and the benefits of removing, rather than adding,
components to systems.</p>
<p>As always, I generate summaries using AI and edit those summaries for
accuracy and usefulness. Then, I offer some thoughts of my own.</p>

<p>The article explores Alan Kay&rsquo;s provocative idea that &ldquo;data&rdquo; might be a
fundamentally flawed concept. It discusses the ethical and political
implications of data, particularly how it objectifies people and
consolidates power in large organizations. The author suggests that data
should be more flexible and context-aware, likening it to &ldquo;ambassadors&rdquo;
in negotiations. The piece calls for rethinking data&rsquo;s role in
representing human identity, emphasizing the need for a human-centric
approach to data management that resists power consolidation.</p>

<p>Part of me feels that, sometimes, computer scientists and software
engineers are better at identifying the problems and stakes of media and
digital tools than the academic humanists who purport to be necessary
for ethical development. Really, though, I think those problems are just
becoming so clear that industry practitioners and academics are growing
towards each other.</p>
<p>In any case, this article does an excellent job of laying out the
dangers of data as an objectifying force in a way that coheres with some
of the best academic scholarship on the topic. Schmudde&rsquo;s observations
that &ldquo;data naturally reduces complex conceptions of identity into coarse
representations&rdquo; and &ldquo;data about identity is generally held in systems
far away from the people they identify&rdquo; essentially summarize the two
broad tendencies of media theory&mdash;representationalist and materialist
perspectives (a spectrum, not a binary)&mdash;in an accessible manner.
Definitely worth a read.</p>

<p>Justine Tunney argues that AI training often strips authorship from
open-source code, erasing the contributions and identities of
developers. She highlights the importance of acknowledging creators to
maintain respect and inspiration within the tech community. Tunney warns
that failing to recognize individual contributions could undermine the
collaborative culture that has driven scientific and technological
progress. She calls for a future where AI enhances attribution rather
than erases it, preserving the connection between creators and their
work.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="my-thoughts-1">
  My Thoughts
  <a class="anchor" href="#my-thoughts-1">#</a>
</h3>
<p>There are several ideas in this article that piqued my humanistic
interest. What are the stakes of authorship? What does AI remember about
us? Who are we in the now-literal machine of history?</p>
<p>While there are several things I like about scholars like Barthes and
Foucault (and even more things I dislike about Foucault), their critique
of authorship and, moreso, the lazy way in which many humanists read it
is so <em>obviously</em> problematic and wrong. It enabled a cascade of bad
takes from across ideologies based on the assumed good of separating
ideas from their authors. Another phrase for this: erasing context.</p>
<p>Tunney&rsquo;s article here highlights one example of this glaring error and
how it is, sadly, one of the clear
<a href="https://v2.nl/articles/surfing-the-accident">accidents</a> (in Virlio&rsquo;s
sense) of AI tools. Tunney writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Open source is a gambit where you give up your leverage to make people
want your thing. So why would anyone do it full time? It&rsquo;s because
what I get paid in, is respect. Folks see my name at the top of each
source code file, and they remember that I was someone who helped
them. It&rsquo;s because if I&rsquo;m respected and people are paying attention to
me, that it becomes easy to find an honest way to survive in the
modern economy. In the future, this might in fact become the only way
to survive.</p></blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Complicating authorship,&rdquo; often (not always) cast as a positive
phenomenon in new media and digital scholarship, is a mistake.</p>

<p>The article discusses the benefits of removing unnecessary elements from
products, projects, or companies to reduce complexity and improve
results. It uses the example of a confusing pricing calculator on a
company&rsquo;s website, which, when removed, led to higher user engagement
and fewer misunderstandings. The author argues that people tend to add
rather than remove things, even when subtraction could provide more
value, and encourages questioning the necessity of each component to
achieve simplicity and effectiveness.</p>
