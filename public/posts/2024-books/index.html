      <p>I fell off the radar a bit at the end of the year but I&rsquo;m back. I&rsquo;ll be
restarting the regular posts soon, but I have a couple 2024 wrap-ups
coming first.</p>
<p>First, here&rsquo;s a collection of thoughts on the books I read this year.
They aren&rsquo;t quite reviews and they aren&rsquo;t (as you might notice)
completely independent of each other. Most of the content is new, but
some of it has been included/reworked from earlier posts.</p>
<p>If you have thoughts on these books, have read them, or simply want more
on one of several of them. Let me know in the comments below.</p>
<pre><code>**Stephen Graham Jones: _My Heart is a Chainsaw._** My favorite aspect
of this book is the narrator's obsessive focus on genre. That being
said, the fact that the book is _not_ actually the genre it purports
to be actually became quite confusing by its end.
**Confucius: _The Analects_**. I've read Confucius several times
before but, given that I am now teaching his ideas in my global
rhetorics-based writing courses, I decided to do a reread of _The
Analects_ toward the beginning of the year. I'm about five years
back into a formal Zen practice, and the cross-contamination between
Confucian thought and Zen Buddhism was evident in this read. Despite
certain overly traditionalist and patriarchal elements of Confucian
thought, which need to be put aside, I really do appreciate the
model of the &quot;good&quot; that The Analects otherwise offers.
**Nietzsche: _The Genealogy of Morals._** It's Nietzsche. What else
new could I say? Maybe this: Nietzsche's understanding of Buddhism
is so wrong it is laughable. That doesn't mean I didn't like it but,
again, what else could I possibly add the discussion of one of the
most important thinkers of the Western tradition?
**Stephen King: _It._** This is, sadly, one of my least favorite books
of all time. I regret saying this not only for the amount of time I
spent reading it but also because I feel ridiculous being critical
of Stephen King. In the same way as the _The Stand_ (everything I
say here applies equally, or moreso, to that book) I wanted to like
this because, well, _it's Stephen King_. But I simply could not get
past how indulgent and offensive the writing was. On the latter
point, _IT_ goes well-beyond being a &quot;time and place&quot; thing and
really is just actively bad in terms of its representation of nearly
every category of person included in the book. I do plan to give
King another shot this year to see if there's anything that clicks.
The book I choose will be substantially shorter.
**Simon Reynolds: _Rip it Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-1984._**
_Rip it Up_ was a fantastic read and gave me a language and a
historical context for several of my favorite bands. It also taught
me that a surprising amount of groups I like from this period
(luckily none of my absolute favorites) were playing _very_ fast and
loose with fascist/Nazi aesthetics. This sucks. But I'd rather know
it than not know it.
**Brian Hodge: _I'll Bring You the Birds from Out of the Sky._** This
was just an absolutely stunning cosmic horror novella. The dread of
certain passages has stuck with me for months and given that my wife
is West Virginian the location was especially intriguing.
**Han Kang: _The Vegetarian_**: I (still) don't even know what to say
about this novel. Most &quot;literary&quot; readers are aware of it by now
but, if you aren't, it's an incredibly haunting text told in three
parts about the dissolution of a Korean family when a woman bucks
social norms by becoming a vegetarian. The story itself, oddly, has
very little to do with vegetarianism and more to do with gender
roles, patriarchy, and social punishment. A must-read.
**Sara Gran: _Come Closer._** If you like horror novels, you need to
read this book. It's haunting, psychological, demonic. It's so
incredibly fucked up. I rarely actually get spooked by reading
horror---this one spooked me good.
**Dan John: _Mass Made Simple._** I am slowly reading everything Dan
John writes about fitness and lifting weights. I'm unsure if I'll
ever run this particular program, but it's filled to the brim with
insights about the practice of weight training in general.
**Oliver Burkeman: _Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for
Mortals._** A few times a year, I usually indulge in my guilty
pleasure of reading a few productivity/self-help books. I nearly
never get anything out of them, but I enjoy them for some reason.
Burkeman's, however, is the rare kind that is actually useful,
normal, applicable to a real person, and worth spending the time
reading.
**Mihály Csíkszentmihályi: _Flow: The Psychology of Optimal
Experience._** This one is the other, more common kind. I recommend
reading one of the eight million blog posts about this book, as
that's about the amount of information it contains when you remove
redundancy.
**Andrew Culp: _Dark Deleuze._** Culp argues that academics have
shockingly (note my sarcasm) deradicalized Deleuze's thought.
Deleuze is my favorite Western philosopher, or at least the one most
influential to my general worldview, and I've had Culp's book on my
reading list for quite a while. It's an odd read for me because I
agree wholeheartedly with Culp's larger points and don't always
appreciate his smaller ones in the construction of the argument. The
book would be of negative interest to anyone not invested in
Deleuze, but it's highly worth a read for anyone who is.
**Immanuel Wallerstein: _World-Systems Analysis: An Introduction._**
One of the most fascinating academic books I've ever read. I have
since read a number of academic articles from the field of sociology
that touch on (positively and critically) world-systems analysis and
I must say that I'm very persuaded by it as a critical lens for
making sense of the world.
**Paul Virilio: _Speed and Politics:_** Virilio got a lot of play on
my blog this year. (See
[here](/posts/2024/09/link-roundup-september-2-2024/) and
[here](/posts/2024/09/cannon-shot-epistemology/).) The idea that
we're all caught up in &quot;habitable circulation&quot; is intriguing and
useful for considering the world around me, despite being at this
point a bit of a cliché.
**Plato: _The Trial and Death of Socrates._** In the age of artificial
intelligence, I find reading Socrates more and more refreshing. I
still disagree on many fundamental conclusions he draws, but
Socratic dialogue and---more fundamentally---the ability to say that
certain things are _bad_ are practices I think we need to recover.
**Paul Kelso: _Powerlifting Basics: Texas Style._** Dumb as hell, but
fun.
**Sarah Manguso: _Ongoingness: The End of a Diary._** Sarah Manguso is
my favorite living writer. _Siste Viator_ was probably the most
influential text for me in college, and everything I've read by her
has left a mark. This book focuses on the author's archival
obsession and her process of releasing it. It is, to me, an
absolutely essential read.
**Claudia Rankine: _Citizen: An American Lyric_**: It's hard to
actually say anything about this powerful book, which feels like a
cop-out. I'm sorry for that. Its experimental, multimediated
construction was a fascinating way for Rankine to deliver her
perspective on race in America.
**Reb Anderson: _Being Upright: Zen Meditation and Bodhisattva
Precepts._** A collection of practices I hope to deepen in 2025.
**Immanuel Wallerstein: _Historical Capitalism with Capitalist
Civilization._** Once again: world-systems analysis is good.
**Oliver Onions: _The Beckoning Fair One._** Lovecraft without the
extraordinary racism that losers on the Internet try to pretend
isn't there. A great ghost story.
**Jacques Rancière: _The Ignorant Schoolmaster._** Probably one of the
best books on teaching I've read. Rather than rehash them, I
encourage you to read
[my
extended thoughts here](/posts/2024/09/the-ignorant-schoolmaster-five-lessons-in-intellectual-emancipation-a-review/).
**Ursula K. Leguin: _The Lathe of Heaven._** Equal parts fantastical
and tragic, _The Lathe of Heaven_ is my favorite Le Guin novel I've
read so far. Among its many themes, one stood out as particularly
significant and ahead of its time. Toward the end of the novel, Orr
is unable to keep track of the various realities affected by his
dreams. &quot;He was living almost as a young child, among actualities
only. He was surprised by nothing, and by everything.&quot; How did Le
Guin blow so effortlessly past postmodernism, perfectly capturing
the post-postmodern regression, the complete capitulation to the
flow, that we see today?
**Anna Kornbluh: _Immediacy: Or, The Style of Too Late Capitalism._**
A good book of social theory. I was more persuaded by it when I read
it than I am now, especially after the publication and seemingly
near-universal praise of _Intermezzo_, which feels exactly like the
type of book/phenomenon that Kornbluh says is less possible these
days. See my [earlier,
actual review](/posts/2024/10/link-roundup-october-8-2024/) for more.
**Samuel Beckett: _Waiting for Godot_.** Reading this in high school
was honestly the thing that spawned my love of the humanities,
literature, philosophy, being a fashionably/unfashionably literary
person (an imaginary type of person, of course), etc. I was
disappointed to find that it really didn't hit the same for me as a
34-year-old in 2024. The sad truth is that the world lacking meaning
doesn't seem radical or even particularly interesting anymore. The
world is absurd! Yep. The real question today, I think, is how do we
get the meaning back in?
**Ta-Nehisi Coates: _The Message._** Coates trying desperately to
consider how writers can get the meaning, and the truth, back in.
Another essential read.
**Dean Young: _The Art of Recklessness._** I picked this up for no
reason when I was between books and unsure what to read next. I've
had it since a college poetry class, and this was a re-read. Was it
interesting? Yeah. Was it useful/sticky for me as a non-poet? I'm
undecided.
**_The Táin: From the Irish Epic Táin Bó Cúailinge._** Irish warrior
mythology? Yes please. It was a bonus to learn that the Irish
clearly invented &quot;going super-saiyan,&quot; as Cú Chulainn does so,
repeatedly, in this epic.
**G. Bruce Boyer: _True Style: The History and Principles of Classic
Menswear._** It is somewhat embarrassing to say out loud (much less
write on my blog) that I am in the process of improving and, maybe
more accurately, becoming more intentional about my sartorial
choices. What I didn't know is that Boyer (and many others) have
done so much work situating men's fashion within a larger
sociological history. This is the only full book on fashion I've
taken this year, but I've read many (_many_) more articles, and
menswear is becoming almost as equally an intellectual rabbit-hole
as practice-based one.
**Sally Rooney: _Intermezzo._** I'm noticing that _everyone_ is
reading this book now. They are right to do so; it's a masterpiece.
It perfectly captures the modern affect. I cried at the end.
**Ryan Gattis: _All Involved._** A fascinating research-based fiction
novel set during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. I strongly encourage
you to at least watch Gattis explain some of the backstory involved
in writing it which is...
[incredible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjK7sTdU72w) and
[terrifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG3tp2oA3xo).
Finished on New Years Eve.
