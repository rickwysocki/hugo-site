<p>The article discusses how journalists are increasingly taking control of
archiving their work due to concerns over the longevity and
accessibility of their content. With traditional news archives often at
risk due to financial instability, ownership changes, or technology
issues, journalists are turning to personal efforts and digital tools to
preserve their reporting. These efforts ensure that their work, which
serves as historical records, remains accessible to the public and
future generations, even if media organizations fail to maintain their
archives.</p>

<p>The creation of <a href="/tags/archival-research">archives</a> was one of the two primary areas of focus in my
doctoral work. The other one was (<a href="/posts/2021/11/what-is-new-about-new-media/">so-called
&ldquo;new&rdquo;</a>)
media theory, so it should be clear that this article speaks to my
interests. The seeming daily occurrence of news sites going dark and its
intersection with the lack of archival efforts was something I hadn&rsquo;t
considered but seems particularly salient after reading the article.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve discussed in <a href="/posts/2021/11/memory-document-archive/">another
post</a>,
there have been significant shifts in how archives are seen across
disciplines. Whereas archives used to be considered passive, objective
containers of the past, they are often seen today as active sites where
memory is <em>made</em>, not simply reflected. And as this article
demonstrates, the way that LLMs are trained on available, existing
resources only further complicates archival work.</p>
<p>What happens, the article asks, when a news article is brought into an
LLM but is then deleted from the web, leaving only its trace in the
&ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; of an AI system? It&rsquo;s a fascinating question. In regards to
that and many other questions, archival science and related humanities
fields are well-suited to offer insights into and warnings about
knowledge-making in the post-AI landscape.</p>

<p>The article advocates for &ldquo;outline speed-running&rdquo; as a method to rapidly
build projects by creating detailed, recursive outlines and then quickly
filling them in without worrying about perfection. This approach
contrasts with the slower &ldquo;loading-bar&rdquo; method, where tasks are
completed sequentially and refined as you go. By focusing on speed and
deferring perfection to the end, this method can lead to a significant
increase in productivity and quality, reducing stress and improving
outcomes.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s becoming unintentionally common for me to include shorter articles
that touch on productivity and writing in these link roundups. In part,
that&rsquo;s because I read <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>
regularly, where these conversations are common. It&rsquo;s also the case that
I&rsquo;m just attracted to these sorts of ideas&hellip; in complicated ways. On
one hand, the field of Writing Studies tends to agree that writing is
best understood and taught as a series of processes rather than using
product-based models such as the now-outdated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theories_of_rhetoric_and_composition_pedagogy#Current-traditional_rhetoric">Current-Traditional
Rhetoric</a>.
In that regard, this article&rsquo;s focus on process is interesting and
insightful.</p>
<p>At the same time, though, I sometimes worry that too much focus on
process creates a different misunderstanding, where writing is put into
the terms of &ldquo;optimization.&rdquo; I have a post in the works about this, but
it&rsquo;s enough to say here that process optimization feels fundamentally at
odds with writing-as-thinking and, sometimes, with actually getting
things done at all. More to come on this topic later in the week.</p>
<p>That said, I do like this article. The idea of &ldquo;loading-bar writing&rdquo;
(writing from the beginning of a document to its end) is a useful
metaphor and one I&rsquo;ll likely share with my students this semester. I
agree with the author that it is often (if not always) a poor and
inefficient writing practice. Additionally, I think the idea of
recursive outlining is useful, and the author&rsquo;s discussion of it aligns
with <a href="/posts/2023/07/ted-nelsons-evolutionary-list-file-and-information-management/">interesting historical conversations about media and thinking
processes</a>.
Regardless of my hang-ups, the article is short and worth a read.</p>
