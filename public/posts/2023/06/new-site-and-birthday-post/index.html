  <p>As you see, I&rsquo;ve fully left Ghost and built out a Hugo site. <a href="/posts/2023-03-10-hugo/">My previous post</a> detailed some of the thinking that went into this site and the reasons for the switch. I&rsquo;m still planning to release the final version as a little theme, but just need to finish getting things squared away on my actual site (here) first.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be working on here include migrating both all my old blog posts and other material here.</p>
<p>Unrelated to the site, it was my birthday a few days ago. I figured I&rsquo;d detail some of the nice things that happened this year.</p>
<ul>
<li>A and I got engaged!</li>
<li>I spent a week at the Rochester Zen Center in sesshin (a Zen method of silent, intensive meditation over a period of days). A very transformative experience.</li>
<li>A taught a number of really successful courses.</li>
<li>I saw a lot of good friends get married.</li>
<li>Relatedly, A and I were able to do some traveling this past year, previously being more locked down due to the pandemic. Looking forward to doing more.</li>
<li>I made a lot of progress in weightlifting, and ran a successful 10k the day after my birthday.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are only a few good things, and a longer list would include lots more. Next steps this summer include wedding planning!</p>
