<h2 id="a-brief-introduction">A Brief Introduction</h2>
<p>So, as  I mentioned <a href="/posts/2024/04/some-updates/">in a recent post</a>, I&rsquo;m fully infected by the puer tea obsession. If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar, puer is a type of fermented tea produced in the Yunnan region of China. It comes in two major varieties, raw/sheng puer and ripe/shou puer. The former is allowed to age naturally (and aging is <strong>a thing</strong> for puer) while the latter goes through a process that was invented to artificially &ldquo;age&rdquo; the tea &ldquo;quicker.&rdquo; Really, though, this process created a whole new variant that shares little resemblance to a raw puer tea that has been aged. Whether raw or ripe, puer is typically pressed into cakes for storage and distribution.</p>

<p>I am not an expert on puer tea, by any means. I&rsquo;ve been slowly <em>trying</em> lots of teas and seeing what I like, but once you get into puer you feel almost immediately how deep the rabbit hole is, and the fact that it is a cross-cultural rabbit hole is especially humbling. What I&rsquo;d like to start doing, though, is posting some of my thoughts as I work through various teas. So, consider this the first post in what I hope will be a series of tea-oriented journal entries. My goal for these entries will be more to learn (through writing) than to teach, but hopefully folks will find something interesting in them.</p>
<h2 id="kuura-cola">Kuura Cola</h2>
<p>Onto the tea at hand. I bought a few cakes of Kuura Cola without sampling them, as the tea gets recommended quite a bit online as a &ldquo;daily drinker.&rdquo; I rarely drink coffee these days, and ripe puer has become its substitute. Ripe puer is usually forgiving to brew <a href="https://marshaln.com/whats-grandpa-style/">&ldquo;grandpa style&rdquo;</a> in my thermos and to take with me all day. Oddly, I&rsquo;ve found Kuura Cola to break that typical mold. It really benefits from gongfu-style brewing, and I&rsquo;ve had less success with grandpa style.</p>

<p>Cola is a pretty standard ripe puer tea, which doesn&rsquo;t mean it isn&rsquo;t good. It&rsquo;s got very sweet notes and very little ripe puer &ldquo;funk.&rdquo; Vanilla is the most dominant flavor to my pallate, and the soup is very thick and dark. KuuraCorp&rsquo;s website claims that drinkers may pick up sweet wood, as well, but I get less of that. This may have something to do with White2Tea&rsquo;s Lumberslut being among my favorite teas, which is&hellip; not subtle in terms of woody flavor profiles. Because of it&rsquo;s pleasant sweetness, I could see Cola being a good introduction to puer. Moreover, I think this would be a good tea if someone wanted to wean themselves off of coffee, as this is a really hearty and full-bodied puer.</p>
<p>According to KuuraCorp, Cola is a blend of puer leaves, fermented in 2018/2019 and pressed in 2020. There isn&rsquo;t too much else in the way of information, other than that Kuura typically sources from Xishuangbanna. This lack of information is actually convenient for me, a new enthusiast for a hobby that is <em>notorious</em> for misinformation and spurious claims to origin. The lack of specificity (and the very reasonable price) makes things simple and easy.</p>
<p>Things were a bit less simple in learning how I liked to brew this tea, though. KuuraCorp mentions giving the cake time to settle, and I strongly agree. Truthfully, I hated the tea when I first sampled it. It initially tasted very mineral-ish, which I don&rsquo;t dislike out of pocket but which was overpowering to the point of almost tasting salty. Once I gave the tea a few weeks to rest, though, the minerality faded and the sweeter notes came forward.</p>
<p>The other surprising thing I learned, mentioned briefly above, is that this tea <em>really</em> shines when brewed gongfu, which is a practice of using a high ratio of leaves to water and brewing leaves several times using relatively short steeps. Many folks online are very&hellip; evangelist about gongfu brewing, which makes sense because it is a wonderful method to brew tea. That said, I am persuaded by those who note that gongfu brewing is:</p>
<ol>
<li>A relatively new phenomenon.</li>
<li>Not the way most people in the world drink tea.</li>
</ol>
<p>While I certainly love brewing gongfu style and nearly always gongfu raw and more expensive ripe puer, I just find myself drinking grandpa style more often. This isn&rsquo;t only because of convenience, but also because some teas just teas taste better to me when brewed grandpa style. Kuura Cola is not one of those teas. I love it when brewed gongfu, but so far the grandpa style brews end up reactivating the minerality that I initially found off-putting.</p>
<p>All that said, I&rsquo;m enjoying Kuura Cola. I&rsquo;ve got a few sessions left of the first cake and then am planning to let the second one sit for a while and see what I think then.</p>
