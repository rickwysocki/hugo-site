  <time datetime="2024-04-04T12:00:22-05:00">April 4, 2024</time>

  <p>With a lot going on in my life (positively), I&rsquo;ve been a bit slow on writing posts here. This week, though, I&rsquo;ve been doing some work around the site and figured I&rsquo;d note a few updates.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Portfolio Updates.</strong> I&rsquo;ve updated the site with a small but growing <a href="/portfolio">portfolio section</a>. The three pieces I&rsquo;ve included so far display some of my technical writing chops in a variety of genres and formats, including updated documentation for my Hugo theme, a technical article I wrote for Hugo image optimization, and a short tutorial I wrote for my students on exporting ChatGPT converstations when they use the tool for writing purposes. (I don&rsquo;t particularly <em>want</em> to write a post on how ChatGPT is affecting writing pedagogy. But, I probably will.)</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Documentation Projects.</strong> I&rsquo;ve also been putting the proverbial money in the area of my mouth lately by contributing documentation to open source projects on GitHub. I spent a few weeks learning the basics of REST API documentation using tools like SwaggerUI, cURL, Postman, and Stoplight. Afterwards, I contributed an OpenAPI specification document that&rsquo;s under review with its developer, and I&rsquo;ve also contributed some smaller-scale documentation to another project. I hope to pull these into my portfolio soon, but for now you can check out my <a href="https://github.com/rickwysocki">GitHub contributions</a> to see the examples. Along these lines, I&rsquo;m looking for more documentation projects to work on. If you&rsquo;re in need of some solid technical writing, don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out. You can email me, or use&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Comments Section.</strong> This is an idea I&rsquo;ve had in my head for a while, and I&rsquo;ve finally decided to go for it. Over the past several months, my site has been getting a lot more hits, so I figured now is a good time. I&rsquo;ll include them selectively on pages where I think an audience might find it useful or fun to comment, and reassess as I go. There&rsquo;s always the possibility that they go empty for a while, and that&rsquo;s okay, too.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Tea.</strong> Unrelated to&hellip; anything else, I&rsquo;ve decided to start a new section/sub-focus for the site. My growing obsession over the past six months or so has been Chinese tea, specifically puer and yancha. I decided this week to just start posting some reviews/notes of the <em>many</em> teas I&rsquo;ve been trying and hopefully building that out into a section of the site. This is all just for fun, and I&rsquo;m certainly not a tea expert&ndash;at the very least, though it will give me a way to archive my thoughts on the teas I&rsquo;m trying. I&rsquo;m finishing two posts on Kuura Cola and a 2018 Bulang raw puer tea from Liquid Proust that I&rsquo;ll publish soon.</p>
