<h2 id="fritz-lang-my-film-m-a-factual-report">Fritz Lang, &ldquo;My Film <em>M</em>: A Factual Report&rdquo;</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1457-my-film-m-a-factual-report" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Link to
Article</a></p>
<h3 id="generated-summary-chatgpt">Generated Summary (ChatGPT)</h3>
<p>In his essay on <em>M</em>, Fritz Lang reflects on his decision to base the
film on real events, inspired by news reports of unsolved murders and
the public's fear in Weimar Germany. Lang aimed to create a work that
would educate and warn society, highlighting the dangers of unchecked
violence and the lurking threat of criminal behavior. He used factual
details to intensify the film&rsquo;s impact, hoping to foster awareness and
perhaps even prevent future tragedies by illustrating the ordinary
settings where horror can unfold.</p>
<h3 id="my-thoughts">My Thoughts</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s always surprising to me just how quickly film became&hellip; good and how
quickly innovation in the medium slowed down. This 1931 film shows its
age in a number of ways, but they mainly have to do with stylistic
elements and genre features: the allowing of actual silence, for
example. In terms of story, cinematography, and social commentary, <em>M</em>
is incredible and far less dated than one would think.</p>
<p>Fritz Lang&rsquo;s own thoughts on his film are fascinating. Two quotes stand out. The first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a more substantial responsibility than the artistic reproduction of
events: the responsibility of sounding a warning from real events, of
educating, and in this way ultimately having a preventive effect. It
would go beyond the scope of this brief comment to dwell on the means
open to such a film to draw attention to the dangers that, given an
incessantly growing crime rate, spell threat and, sadly, all too
often, disaster for people at large, children and youngsters in
particular; to illuminate the ordinariness and banality with which
they announce themselves; to educate; and, most important of all, to
have a preventive impact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So much for the arguments that movies today are bad because they are too
socially oriented. In fact, the exact inverse is true: films today fail
when they assume a <em>false</em> stance of social justice that, in reality,
serves only as a money-printing machine for studios. This is certainly
not true of all films today (there is an embarrassment of good ones),
but there is a tendency not toward actual social issues but toward
pleasing the audience that has, really, run its course. Which leads to
the second quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the film should give the impression at certain points of a moving
spotlight, revealing with greatest clarity the thing on which its cone
of light is directed at the time: the grotesqueness of an audience
infected with a murder psychosis, on the one hand, and the gruesome
monotony with which an unknown murderer, armed with a few candies, an
apple, a toy, can spell disaster for any child in the street, any
child outside the protection of his family or the authorities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is wonderful about <em>M</em> is that it is truly an uncomfortable
indictment of society&rsquo;s contradictions rather than what we get today:
movies that are about one edgy douche &ldquo;against&rdquo; &ldquo;society.&rdquo; Ultimately,
Beckert&rsquo;s terrible actions are just a foil, a machine error that allows
his society to fully reveal itself as a character, and an unreliable
one. And it&rsquo;s interesting how purposeful Lang was in implicating the
audience in that unreliability.</p>

<h3 id="generated-summary-chatgpt-1">Generated Summary (ChatGPT)</h3>
<p>Michael Engen describes building his online resume using HTML, CSS, and
Eleventy, a static site generator. He outlines the benefits of this
approach, like flexible layouts, easier version control, and printable
PDFs. He structures his resume data using JSON, integrates it with HTML
templates, and styles it using CSS grid layouts. To streamline updates
and maintain a responsive design, he leverages Eleventy&rsquo;s local server
and Puppeteer for automated PDF generation. His project emphasizes a
web-native resume that's accessible and adaptable.</p>

<p>This is just very cool. As anyone who reads my posts knows, I&rsquo;m an
enthusiast for markup languages and, more specifically, interesting use
cases for them. I will now be following this tutorial and porting it
over to Hugo, haha.</p>
