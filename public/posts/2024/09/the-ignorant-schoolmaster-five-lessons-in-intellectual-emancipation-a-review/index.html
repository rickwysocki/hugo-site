  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Jacques Rancière&rsquo;s <em>The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons In
Intellectual Emancipation</em> is difficult to categorize. Reminiscent of
certain work of Michel Serres and other post-deconstruction French
philosophers, Rancière is more interested in creatively orienting the
reader toward their own thought and humanity than in presenting a
unified philosophical argument. He begins with a seemingly forgettable
curiosity in the history of French pedagogy where Joseph Jacotot taught
Flemish students French with nothing but a single French text and a
complete ignorance of the Flemish language. Across five essays, he
extrapolates Jacotot&rsquo;s method of &ldquo;universal teaching,&rdquo; that is, helping
students to recognize their intellectual equality without the
explication of &ldquo;knowledgeable&rdquo; teacher.</p>
<p>To say the book is about teaching, however, translates only a fragment
of Rancière&rsquo;s inquiry, which dances across topics as seemingly disperse
as the history of Western philosophy and rhetoric; social inequality and
class-systems; the fiction of progressive rationality; and the &ldquo;secret
of genius&rdquo; that any student can achieve through an emancipated
self-directed inquiry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s helpful to know that this is not a book to be picked up on Friday to develop a lesson
plan for Monday. It <strong>is</strong> a philosophy of pedagogy. That much is true.
But Rancière is not only disinterested in helping teachers better
deliver material to their students; he is critical of teaching
through transmission, referred to throughout the book as
<em>explication</em>, entirely.</p>
<h2 id="explication-and-emancipation">Explication and Emancipation</h2>
<p>Explication refers to any teaching style that assumes knowledge is
&ldquo;held&rdquo; by the teacher which the student must, based on the teacher&rsquo;s
interventions of one sort or another, approximate and thereby &ldquo;learn.&rdquo;
The problem with this method, for Rancière, is the inequality created,
an &ldquo;enforced stultification&rdquo; that renders the student definitionally
incapable of ever catching up to the teacher (7, 8). He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is stultification whenever one intelligence is subordinated to
another. A person&ndash;and a child in particular&ndash;may need a master when
his own will is not strong enough to set him on track and keep him
there. But that subjection is purely one of will over will. It becomes
stultification when it links an intelligence to another intelligence.
. . . We will call the known and maintained difference of the two
revelations&ndash;the act of an intelligence obeying only itself even
while the will obeys another will&ndash;emancipation. (13)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are multiple problems with explication. On one hand, it creates a
division between the supposedly superior and inferior intelligences of
the teacher and student, denying the student a full recognition of their
intellectual power that is equally shared across all humans.
Additionally, it produces the academic tendency to separate the
intelligence of the working class and the academic class, rationalizing
and supporting social division (37).</p>
<p>The alternative is termed emancipation. In this model, the &ldquo;ignorant&rdquo;
teacher holds no special knowledge, and indeed will often teach what
they themselves do not know. Instead, the teacher&rsquo;s role is to oblige
and authorize students to realize their capabilities of self-learning
through the mediating force of a shared text (a &ldquo;thing in common&rdquo;), not
to explicate material for them (15). Put another way, teachers
emancipate by creating conditions for students to immerse themselves in
a &ldquo;thing in common&rdquo; and by asking them to share, though their own
language, what they know. The only necessary intervention is to verify
that the student has earnestly and intellectually engaged in a process
of self-learning, not to transmit material <em>to</em> them (31).</p>
<p>Understanding, from this view, isn&rsquo;t a goal but an inherent capability.
The student must realize that knowledge is always and only ever a
process of ongoing translation through the repetition and reworking of
the &ldquo;thing in common&rdquo; through language.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was only one rule: [the student] must be able to show, in the book, the
materiality of everything he says. He will be asked to write
compositions and perform improvisations under the same conditions: he
must use the words and turns of phrase in the book to construct his
sentences; he must show, in the book, the facts on which his reasoning
is based. In short, the master must be able to verify in the book the
materiality of everything the student says. (20)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone is equally intelligent, and that intelligence can be
emancipated through willful repetition, by &ldquo;learning, repeating,
imitating, translating, taking apart, putting back together&rdquo; (55, 68).
Again, these seemingly practical recommendations are made complex by the
fact that <em>any</em> attempt to &ldquo;lead&rdquo; the student to a predetermined
conclusion&mdash;even using a supposedly Socratic method (29, 58)&mdash;falls
back into explication and reproduces a superiority/inferiority of
intellect.</p>
<h2 id="on-rhetoric-and-the-us-university">On Rhetoric and the US University</h2>
<p>Rancière&rsquo;s argument is expansive&mdash;more so, at least, than its slim
pages suggest. I want to touch on just one other element, which is
Rancière&rsquo;s critique of rhetoric. Throughout the book, Ranciére describes
rhetoric as a tool not for &ldquo;figur[ing] out&rdquo; but for &ldquo;be[ing]
listened to&rdquo; (68). He refers to rhetoric, from this perspective, as &ldquo;the
art of <em>reasoning</em> that tries to annihilate reason under the guise of
reason&rdquo; and as a perverted poetry (83-84). Elsewhere, he writes
&ldquo;Rhetoric is speech in revolt against the poetic condition of the
speaking being. It speaks in order to silence. <em>You will speak no
longer, you will think no longer, you will do this</em>: That is it&rsquo;s
program&rdquo; (85).</p>
<p><strong>Let me be clear:</strong> If I agreed with this critique entirely, I would be a
very uncomfortable teacher of rhetoric and writing courses, and I would
be very sad about my wasted time earning a Ph.D. Jaded as I
am, I still believe that rhetorical inquiry serves a purpose beyond the
application and maintenance of power.</p>
<p><em>Yet</em>. Rancière&rsquo;s critique of rhetoric does feel uncomfortably salient
and more relevant than I would like. Due to political and economic
realities, the field of English has for some time been largely rebranded
in terms of job preparation and who will be the best operators of
communications technology. In this shifting context, it seems as though
rhetoric, composition, technical communication, and all of the related
disciplines focusing on &ldquo;real world&rdquo; communication have gained purchase.
In this movement, the value of language study has been largely reframed
into various versions of the idea that the professional world needs
better communicators&mdash;that is, better explicators.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with (or, maybe, no way to avoid) this idea as a
part of rhetorical study and a piece of the larger pie of higher
education. But what do we lose when the material conditions of education
make it less and less feasible to give students a book and to honestly,
earnestly ask them what they think, as equals?</p>
<p>Rancière concludes the book with an essay on the impossibility of
institutionalizing universal teaching and closes with the following
line: &ldquo;The Founder (Jacotot) had predicted it all: universal teaching
wouldn&rsquo;t take. He also added that it would not perish&rdquo; (139).</p>
