  <p>This post discusses a meta-analysis of studies related to trust in AI
systems published by Alexandra D. Kaplan, Theresa T. Kessler, J.
Christopher Brill, and P. A. Hancock in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00187208211013988"><em>Human Factors: The Journal of
the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society</em>.</a> As I review it, I
consider its implications for how AI might continue to be taken up in work contexts.</p>
<p>One of the things you notice in conversations about AI is how extreme
the question of trust can be. Some folks immediately discredit using AI,
while others accept it uncritically. Binary thinking is easy when any
new technology pops up, but given AI&rsquo;s radical potential to transform
activity it feels understandable, if somewhat misguided.</p>
<p>Personally, my perspective on AI tools is neither wholly positive nor
negative. I tend to start from the assumption that they are &ldquo;are here,&rdquo;
that it&rsquo;s better to understand them, their affordances, and their
limitations than to ignore them. Kaplan et al.&rsquo;s meta-analysis is useful in that effort.</p>
<h2 id="article-methodology-and-overview">Article Methodology and Overview</h2>
<p>Kaplan et al. analyzed 65 articles in their meta-analysis. Specifically,
they included articles that addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relationships between the human trustor, the AI trustee, and their
shared context.</li>
<li>Human characteristics and abilities.</li>
<li>AI performance and attributes.</li>
<li>Contextual multitasking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Studies that met the following criteria were included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studies that were peer-reviewed.</li>
<li>Studies where trust in AI was a dependent variable.</li>
<li>Studies with enough statistical data to determine effect size.</li>
<li>Studies that did not include vulnerable populations.</li>
<li>English-based studies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Across the 65 articles, Kaplan et al. noted four common &ldquo;delivery
systems&rdquo; for AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chatbots.</li>
<li>Robots.</li>
<li>Automated vehicles.</li>
<li>Non-embodied AI/algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the authors noted several limitations in their meta-analysis,
their findings pose interesting considerations and questions about trust
in AI systems.</p>
<h2 id="trust-in-ai">Trust in AI</h2>
<p>So, what factors affect an individual&rsquo;s trust in AI? Kaplan et al.
highlighted several fascinating responses to that question. It&rsquo;s useful
to point out, though, that the authors didn&rsquo;t engage the question of
whether we <strong>should</strong> trust AI systems. This is understandable for many
reasons, including the nature of their study and the difficulty of
assessing AI <em>in general</em>. Personally, I think it&rsquo;s going to be
increasingly less useful to talk about AI as &ldquo;a thing.&rdquo; To ask whether
we should trust AI, in my view, will soon be like asking whether we
should trust websites. <em>&ldquo;Well&hellip; It depends</em> <em>on the site and how you
are using it, obviously.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>That said, I am going to take the authors&rsquo; lead and offer less of my own
thoughts on the trustworthiness of specific technologies. It seems more
interesting to think through and play out what their findings tell us
about how and why individuals trust/distrust AI systems.</p>
<h3 id="human-factors-related-to-trust-in-ai">Human Factors Related to Trust in AI</h3>
<p>Across the surveyed studies, the authors noted several human factors
that were predictors of trust in AI systems. Personality, culture, and
identity factors were found relevant. A few examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Lonely participants&rdquo; in studies were found less likely to trust AI
while &ldquo;innovative individuals&rdquo; were more likely to pursue its use.</li>
<li>A variety of cultural factors and identities were found to affect
trust. For example, Germans were more trusting, whereas Japanese
individuals tended toward skepticism.</li>
<li>Male participants were generally more willing to trust AI than
female participants (343).</li>
</ol>
<p>While specific findings may be individually more or less surprising, it
seems fairly evident that human factors would play into trust in AI.</p>
<p>One of their findings, though, was more compelling to me because it was
something I hadn&rsquo;t considered. Kaplan et al. noted that an individual
user&rsquo;s technical competency and understanding of an AI system are seen
to be positive predictors of trust. Additionally, a user&rsquo;s expertise in
their tasks&mdash;what they are trying to <strong>do</strong> with AI&mdash;also factored
positively (343). <strong>What this suggests, to me, is that a large part of
achieving trust in AI systems is increasing knowledge of how they
function and fostering environments where goals can be met through their
use.</strong></p>
<p>Many technical folks know the anxious feeling of trying to set up a
friend or family member with a &ldquo;cool new tech&rdquo; and have it not work
immediately. (If it&rsquo;s not obvious, I&rsquo;m talking about myself here.) The
anxiety comes from knowing that while the fix may take seconds, trust in
the system is diminished and might not recover. In terms of AI, it seems
like the same phenomenon is at play. <strong>If one&rsquo;s goal is to increase
trust in an AI system (which, again, I&rsquo;m not saying should be true in
every situation), then creating small-scale positive outcomes seems more
important than riskier attempts at paradigm shifts.</strong></p>
<h3 id="technological-factors-related-to-trust-in-ai">Technological Factors Related to Trust in AI</h3>
<p>Across the 65 articles, there were also many findings about how AI
systems, as technology, factored into user trust. The reliability and
performance of an AI system were highly predictive of trust (344). More
than that, though, the <em>visibility</em> of possible failure or negative
outcomes is correlated to trust, as well. Because of the possibility for
AI systems to &ldquo;exhibit undesirable behavior,&rdquo; humans need &ldquo;properly
calibrated trust in AI systems [that] highlight the potential for
negative outcomes&rdquo; (347).</p>
<p>This visibility may be increasingly difficult as AI systems continue to
develop, though. The authors warned that AI may continue to develop as
black boxes to users. While this has clear issues related to human
agency, a corollary concern is that it will decrease trust in AI
systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While current iterations of AI do not have an internal drive to misbehave, lack of transparency in some systems may seem to indicate deception to some users. Self-repairing code and learning systems that generate new code based upon experience do not require a user&rsquo;s input. Systems will, therefore, become increasingly &lsquo;black boxes,&rsquo; leaving the human beyond the loop on decisions and may subsequently then be (mis)interpreted as devious or deceptive. (347)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Trust doesn&rsquo;t just depend on success, but an understanding of possible points of
failure/limitations. But this understanding may be made difficult by
technological development.</strong></p>
<h3 id="trust-in-context">Trust in Context</h3>
<p>Finally, the authors discussed contextual factors related to trust in
AI. For example, the &ldquo;personality&rdquo; of an AI system was relevant to the
amount of trust it provoked. People preferred AI systems that
encouraged collaboration but, maybe obviously, distrusted ones where
they perceived elements of deception (344). They also preferred
voice-based communication over text (344-45).</p>
<p>The reputation of the AI system was also found to drive trust (344).
This finding calls up the question of marketing of AI systems and how that might transform their uptake. What feels so significant about <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-and-apple-announce-partnership/">Apple&rsquo;s partnership with OpenAI</a> is that it gives the latter company access to Apple&rsquo;s fairly stellar reputation. <strong>For better
or worse, the marketing of &ldquo;Apple Intelligence&rdquo; (see the video
below) feels much more&hellip; reassuring than OpenAI. I sense that this will
lead to more widespread adoption of and trust in AI tools.</strong></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve highlighted what I see as the main implications of Kaplan et al.&rsquo;s
findings above, but here is a quick review.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trust is increased by functional knowledge of an AI system.</li>
<li>If one&rsquo;s goal is to increase trust in an AI system, then creating
small-scale positive outcomes seems more important than paradigm
shifts.</li>
<li>Helping users understand points of failure/limitations of AI is
central to developing trust. But this understanding may be made
difficult as they continue to be &ldquo;black-boxed.&rdquo;</li>
<li>As with all technologies, marketing and brand recognition will play
a central role in increasing trust and adoption.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m purposely avoiding whether we <strong>should</strong> trust a given AI
system because that question is simply too large to answer in general.
But, to the degree that AI tools will be accepted and reshape labor,
it&rsquo;s worth being aware of the reasons that individuals trust them, or
not. I definitely recommend Kaplan et al.&rsquo;s meta-analysis for more
detail on the topic.</p>
