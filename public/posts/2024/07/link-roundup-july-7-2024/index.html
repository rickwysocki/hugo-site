  <p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This post is a day early, as I&rsquo;ll be on my <strong>honeymoon</strong> this week.</em></p>
<p>This week I&rsquo;ve included articles on mindfulness in technical writing
(Tom Johnson), friction in software development (Wayne), and the
extraordinarily concerning environmental implications of Hurricane Beryl (Berger).</p>
<p>As always, I generate summaries using AI and edit those summaries for
accuracy and usefulness. Then, I offer some thoughts of my own.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also love for you to check out <a href="/posts/2024/07/article-review-trust-in-artificial-intelligence/">my write-up of &ldquo;Trust in Artificial
Intelligence: Meta-Analytic Findings,&rdquo;</a> a recent article published by
Alexandra D. Kaplan, Theresa T. Kessler, J. Christopher Brill, and P. A.
Hancock. It seemed a bit goofy to include one of my own posts in the
link roundup last week, so I figure I&rsquo;ll include my own work in
these brief introductions going forward.</p>
<h2 id="tom-johnson-seeing-invisible-details-and-avoiding-predictable-conditioned-thought">Tom Johnson, &ldquo;Seeing invisible details and avoiding predictable, conditioned thought&rdquo;</h2>
<p><a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/zamm/seeing-invisible-details-avoiding-predictable-thought.html">Link to
Article</a></p>
<h3 id="generated-summary-chatgpt">Generated Summary (ChatGPT)</h3>
<p>The article discusses the importance of perceiving subtle details and
avoiding predictable, conditioned thinking. Johnson emphasizes that
being able to see the &quot;invisible&quot; details can lead to deeper insights
and more creative solutions and discusses how this relates to AI tools
and writing. He suggests cultivating a mindset that challenges
assumptions and habitual patterns of thought, which can help recognize
overlooked opportunities and solve problems more effectively.</p>
<h3 id="my-thoughts">My Thoughts</h3>
<p>This post almost seems to be addressed directly to me, as it touches on
nearly every topic I find captivating: Zen Buddhism, technical writing,
literary theory and philosophy, and the importance of paying attention.
His emphasis on defamiliarization, noticing, and asking questions are
qualities I try to cultivate daily, and the way he applies those general
life-enhancing techniques to writing and AI tools is something that,
itself, is defamiliarizing and valuable. As with pretty much everything
I read on Johnson&rsquo;s blog, I highly recommend this one.</p>
<h2 id="hillel-wayne-software-friction">Hillel Wayne, &ldquo;Software Friction&rdquo;</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/software-friction/">Link to Article</a></p>
<h3 id="generated-summary-chatgpt-1">Generated Summary (ChatGPT)</h3>
<p>Wayne explores the concept of friction in software development, drawing
an analogy to military friction as defined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_von_Clausewitz">Carl von Clausewitz</a>. Wayne
identifies various sources of software friction, such as changing APIs,
bugs, unclear requirements, and tool failures. He suggests strategies to
mitigate friction, including smaller scopes, more autonomy, redundancy,
better planning, automation, and gaining experience through gaming and
checklists. Wayne emphasizes that while friction is inevitable,
effective management can reduce its impact.</p>
<h3 id="my-thoughts-1">My Thoughts</h3>
<p>I saw this posted on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> and
found it thought-provoking. I think the definition of friction Wayne
develops from Clausewitz&mdash;the delta between our theoretical experience
and our actual experience&mdash;is interesting and applies to a host of
topics. We see friction in our relationships, our lifepaths, our uptake
of new tools, and&mdash;as Wayne points out primarily&mdash;in software
development. Wayne also poses a lot of interesting questions about
friction toward the end of his article, a move that connects nicely to Tom
Johnson&rsquo;s post above.</p>
<h2 id="eric-berger-yes-you-should-be-a-little-freaked-out-about-hurricane-beryl">Eric Berger, &ldquo;Yes, you should be a little freaked out about Hurricane Beryl&rdquo;</h2>

Article</a></p>
<h3 id="generated-summary-chatgpt-2">Generated Summary (ChatGPT)</h3>
<p>The Atlantic hurricane season, starting June 1, usually sees significant
activity in August or September. This year, however, unusually warm sea
temperatures have led to the rapid intensification of Hurricane Beryl,
which became a Category 5 storm with 165 mph winds on July 1. This is
the earliest such storm on record. Beryl's unprecedented development
early in the season is alarming and may signal a hyperactive hurricane
season, influenced by climate change and La Ni√±a. Although Beryl is
expected to weaken, it remains a major concern for Jamaica and Mexico's
Yucatan peninsula. This early and intense activity highlights the
increasing severity of hurricanes due to warmer seas.</p>
<h3 id="my-thoughts-2">My Thoughts</h3>
<p>Here, I&rsquo;m just going to include a quote from Berger:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The emerging consensus from scientists has been that there will be a 1
to 10 percent increase in tropical cyclone intensities and that the
proportion of major hurricanes will increase. But even in such a
world, Beryl would be an outlier. That we're already seeing
superstorms develop in late June and early July should concern
everyone everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s real out here, and it&rsquo;s definitely concerning.</p>
