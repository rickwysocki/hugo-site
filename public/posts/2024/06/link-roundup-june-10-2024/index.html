  <p>Here are a few links I found interesting this week. Following a technique I noticed on <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/blog/links-around-web-june-10-2024">Tom Johnson&rsquo;s blog</a> (as well as the theme of the articles), I use AI tools to help provide summaries and then offer some thoughts of my own.</p>
<h2 id="apple-introducing-apple-intelligence-the-personal-intelligence-system-that-puts-powerful-generative-models-at-the-core-of-iphone-ipad-and-mac">Apple, &ldquo;Introducing Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that puts powerful generative models at the core of iPhone, iPad, and Mac&rdquo;</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/introducing-apple-intelligence-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">Link to Article</a></p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Apple is introducing a new personal intelligence system called Apple Intelligence that will be integrated across iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices. Some key features of Apple Intelligence include:</p>
<ul>
<li>New systemwide Writing Tools.</li>
<li>Improved photo and video search capabilities.</li>
<li>Integration of ChatGPT across Apple platforms.</li>
<li>New email features like Priority Messages and smart summaries in the Mail app.</li>
<li>Improved Siri capabilities.</li>
<li>A new &ldquo;Image Playground&rdquo; feature.</li>
<li>A focus on privacy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="my-thoughts">My Thoughts</h3>
<p>It will be <strong>extraordinarily interesting</strong> to see how this reshapes conversations about AI. Personally, I&rsquo;m really interested in how this ease of access will alter conversations about these new tools in higher education. I&rsquo;ve already begun to adapt to these tools and integrate them into my workflows (for quite a while now, actually), as have many folks working in various writing professions, such as technical communication. In my view, though, many academics in writing-related fields haven&rsquo;t seriously engaged them. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing how this continues to develop in the Fall.</p>

<h3 id="summary-1">Summary</h3>
<p>Apple announced at the Worldwide Developer Conference 2024 that they&rsquo;re integrating ChatGPT into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, enabling seamless access to its capabilities like image and document understanding without switching between apps. The integration, powered by GPT-4o, will roll out later in the year, offering free access and optional premium features for ChatGPT subscribers.</p>
<h3 id="my-thoughts-1">My Thoughts</h3>
<p>Similar to my comments above, I&rsquo;m just struck by how accessible AI tools are about to be for <strong>everyone</strong>, and how inextricable they will be from other types of work. The line between work done with AI tools and work done without AI tools will soon become meaningless, I think. Anyone in knowledge work will need to embrace them and be conscious of both their value and limitations. Ignoring them, though, is not a possibility.</p>
