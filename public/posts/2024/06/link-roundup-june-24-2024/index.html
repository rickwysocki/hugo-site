  <p>This week, we&rsquo;ve got two links: one on the relationship between AI and
environmental concerns, and one on action titles as a tool for slide
design.</p>
<p>In these link roundups, I generate summaries using AI and edit those
summaries for accuracy and usefulness. Then, I offer some thoughts of my
own.</p>

Article</a></p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) significantly impacts the environment
beyond its carbon dioxide emissions from training and running systems,
as its diverse applications often have greater effects. Experts like
Jesse Dodge and David Rolnick emphasize that AI&rsquo;s primary environmental
impact comes from its usage, which can either harm or help the
environment. For instance, AI can increase fossil fuel production,
exacerbating emissions, but it also aids in disaster response and
emissions monitoring through tools like xView2 and Climate TRACE.
Effective climate action requires addressing AI's emissions and
applications, with ethical guidelines and policies to minimize harm and
maximize benefits.</p>
<h3 id="my-thoughts">My Thoughts</h3>
<p>I found this to be a really interesting take on the relationship between
AI technologies and environmental impacts. I have a lot of qualms about
the environmental aspects involved in developing LLMs. Still, I appreciate
Coleman&rsquo;s reminder that these impacts are context-based, and that AI can
also be put to use for noble environmental purposes. As always, I would
argue that a more engaged humanities would be especially
well-suited to help guide technological development toward these
applications.</p>
<h2 id="alexandra-hazard-kampmann-matz-stigzelius-how-to-write-slide-action-titles-like-mckinsey-withexamples">Alexandra Hazard Kampmann, Matz Stigzelius, &ldquo;How to Write Slide Action Titles Like McKinsey (WithÂ Examples)&rdquo;</h2>
<p><a href="https://slideworks.io/resources/how-to-write-action-titles-like-mckinsey">Link to
Article</a></p>
<h3 id="generated-summary-chatgpt-1">Generated Summary (ChatGPT)</h3>
<p>The Slideworks.io article on writing action titles like McKinsey
explains the importance of action titles in PowerPoint presentations. An
action title conveys the main takeaway of a slide in a concise, active
sentence, improving clarity, cohesiveness, and impact. The article
provides steps and best practices for crafting effective action titles,
such as being specific, concise, and using an active voice. These titles
help to structure the presentation's storyline and ensure that each
slide's message is clear and compelling.</p>
<h3 id="my-thoughts-1">My Thoughts</h3>
<p>I typically teach slide design using Edward Tufte&rsquo;s principles for
information-rich visual content. I came across this link, and I&rsquo;m
honestly not entirely sure how I feel about its recommendations. While
it has merit in terms of foregrounding clarity and concision, at times I
feel like this falls more in line with some of the things that Tufte,
for example, would see as non-essential visual information. In any case,
I did find it useful and may use it as a counterpoint example for
business and technical writing students.</p>
