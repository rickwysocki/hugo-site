  <h1>Joker: Folie à Deux</h1>

  <p>I have to assume that <em>Joker 2: Folie à Deux</em> lacked what audiences
loved about Todd Phillip&rsquo;s first <em>Joker</em> film. The assumption is
necessary, because I didn&rsquo;t like the first film either. I found the
breathless discourse about the earlier movie as ridiculous as most
normal people did. But I <em>was</em> put off by its &ldquo;don&rsquo;t cut yourself on my
edge&rdquo; ethos, which was&mdash;truthfully&mdash;a bit boring.</p>
<p>This one, though. <em>This one, though.</em> There is always a recency bias
when dealing superlatively, but I haven&rsquo;t come up with a more
frustrating movie than <em>Folie à Deux</em> since seeing it in the theater.
Don&rsquo;t call its narrative difficult. Don&rsquo;t call its genre bending
unbounded. Don&rsquo;t call its refusal of expectations an creative choice by
cinematic <em>auteur.</em> Audiences should refuse back, because every one of
these decisions is, today, precisely what makes this film so uncreative.</p>
<p><em>Folie à Deux</em> bets all of its chips on genre bending as interesting and
subverting expectations as radical. It <em>begs</em> the audience to audience
to accept. <em>But folks. It is 2024.</em> These are a few trailers that showed
before <em>Joker</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Kraven the Hunter.</em> A Marvel movie that is also an R-rated, violent
revenge film.</li>
<li><em>Red One.</em> A Christmas Santa-Claus movie that is also an action
movie that is also a comedy movie and that is also clearly following
the Marvel formula.</li>
<li><em>Venom:</em> <em>The Last Dance.</em> A superhero movie that (whoa guys)
<em>isn&rsquo;t</em> a Marvel film. This one&rsquo;s dark.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Folie à Deux</em>, blending genres like the musical, the psychological
thriller, and&ndash;<em>again!</em>&ndash;the superhero movie, pleads with viewers to
accept that it is novel, radical, different.</p>
<p>The problem is, it&rsquo;s not. Today, the genre-bent movie <em>is the dominant
genre</em>. Subverted expectations <em>is the primary expectation of
audiences.</em> For crying out loud, M. Knight Shyamalan now regularly
<em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> put twists or ambiguity into his movies, which is more
surprising than if he had.</p>
<p>The remainder of <em>Folie à Deux</em>, beyond its undelivered-upon demands on
the audience, is boringly offensive and offensively boring. It would
honestly have been more surprising if this film had, after the first
<em>Joker</em>, just done the most normative superhero movie possible. I&rsquo;m
talking spandex. I&rsquo;m talking costumes with nipples, for some reason. I&rsquo;m
talking <em>Zoinks! Boom! Pow!</em> All of this would have been more
interesting and, at this point, somehow more original than <em>Folie à
Deux.</em></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stop making &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t it be weird/cool/interesting if&hellip;&rdquo; movies.
Good ones are good enough.</p>
