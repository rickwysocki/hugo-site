I am a seasoned writing educator with ten years of experience teaching university courses. During this time I've taught a number of courses in the areas of technical communication, business and professional writing, and academic research writing. As a teacher I'm passionate about creating immersive learning environments that give students the tools necessary to effectively communicate information to audiences across diverse contexts.

I hold a Ph.D in Rhetoric and Composition from the University of Louisville. My dissertation explored the documentation practices involved in the creation of the Williams-Nichols Archive, a collection of LGBTQ history assembled by Louisville activist David Williams and now held by the University of Louisville. This research led to a publication in *Rhetoric Review*, a premiere peer-reviewed journal in the field of rhetoric studies. I've additionally published a number of other academic pieces in both print and born-digital modalities.

Alongside my teaching and academic work, I also have many years of editorial experience. From 2014-2015, I worked the *Henry James Review*, the flagship journal for work on the author. In that role, I reviewed manuscript submissions, copyedited accepted pieces, prepared manuscript files for our publisher at Johns Hopkins University Press, and proofed final copies for errors. For the last several years, I've worked as a Section Editor at *[Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net)*. At *Kairos*--a journal of born-digital scholarly work--I use my knowledge of [web design and markup languages](/skills/web-design) to help authors realize born-digital scholarship. Additionally, I work on the production cycle for each issue ensuring proper metadata, [HTML5 syntax](/skills/html5-/-css), and accessibility measures are present in published work.

As indicated in the previous paragraph, I have a strong enthusiasm for technology, and much of my free time is spent learning and exploring digital tools. On any given day, this might involve:

- Hugo (the framework with which I built this site).
- Industry-standard content technologies, such as Articulate .
- Max/MSP (an environment for creating complex audio and video installations).

I'm always happy to chat, so if any of the above is interesting to you, don't hesitate to reach out!

I'm moving a lot of content from different places, including blog posts, teaching materials, and professional documents. There will almost certainly be a few mistakes across the site for a bit.
