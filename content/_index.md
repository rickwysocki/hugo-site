I am a seasoned writing educator with ten years of university-level teaching experience. During this time I've designed and taught courses on technical communication, business and professional writing, and academic research writing. I'm passionate about creating immersive learning environments that give students the tools to effectively communicate information to audiences across diverse contexts.

I hold a Ph. D. in Rhetoric and Composition from the University of Louisville. [My dissertation](/research/dissertation) explored the documentation practices involved in the creation of the Williams-Nichols Archive, a collection of LGBTQ history assembled by Louisville activist David Williams and now held by the University of Louisville. This research led to [a publication in *Rhetoric Review*](/research/disidentification-and-documentation), a premier peer-reviewed journal in the field of rhetoric studies. I've additionally published a number of other academic pieces in both print and born-digital modalities.

Alongside my teaching and academic work, I also have many years of editorial experience. From 2014-2015, I worked at the *Henry James Review*, the flagship journal for Henry James studies There, I reviewed manuscript submissions, copyedited accepted pieces, prepared manuscript files for our publisher at Johns Hopkins University Press, and proofed final copies for errors. For the last several years, I've worked as a Section Editor at *[Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net)*. At *Kairos*--a journal of born-digital scholarly work--I use my knowledge of [web design and markup languages](/skills/web-design) to help authors realize born-digital scholarship. Additionally, I work on the production cycle for each issue ensuring proper metadata, [HTML5 syntax](/skills/html5-/-css), and accessibility measures are present in published work.

I have a strong enthusiasm for technology, and much of my free time is spent learning and exploring digital tools. On any given day, I might be working on / with:

- [Little Ghost](https://github.com/rickwysocki/littleGhost), a simple but extensible theme I've developed for the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
- Industry-standard content tools and technologies, such as XML or Articulate 360.
- [Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max), an environment for creating complex audio and video installations.

I'm always happy to chat, so if any of the above is interesting to you, don't hesitate to reach out.
