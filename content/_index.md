I am a writing educator with ten years of university-level teaching experience. I've designed and taught courses on technical communication, business and professional writing, and academic research writing. As a teacher, I'm passionate about creating immersive learning environments that give students the tools to communicate information to audiences across diverse contexts.

I hold a Ph. D. in Rhetoric and Composition from the University of Louisville. [My dissertation](http://localhost:1313/research/dissertation) explored the documentation practices involved in the creation of the Williams-Nichols Archive, a collection of LGBTQ history assembled by Louisville activist David Williams and now held by the University of Louisville. This research led to [a publication in Rhetoric Review](http://localhost:1313/research/disidentification-and-documentation), a premier peer-reviewed journal in rhetoric studies. Additionally, I've published print-based and born-digital research in several other academic publications.

I also have many years of editorial experience. In 2014-2015, I worked at the _Henry James Review_, the flagship journal for Henry James studies. My work involved:

- reviewing manuscript submissions,
- copyediting accepted pieces,
- preparing manuscript files for our publisher at Johns Hopkins University Press,
- and proofing final copies for errors.

Today, I serve as a Section Editor at [Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/), a journal of born-digital scholarly work. Here, I use my knowledge of [web design and markup languages](http://localhost:1313/skills/web-design) to help authors realize born-digital scholarship. Additionally, I work on the production cycle for each issue ensuring proper metadata, [HTML5 syntax](http://localhost:1313/skills/html5-/-css), and accessibility measures are present in published work.

Outside of my academic work, I am also engaged in the following projects:

- Serving my community as a Board Member and Grant Writer at the [Soup Kitchen of Muncie](https://soupkitchenofmuncie.org/).
- Learning the Korean language. (I'm still a beginner, but it's so much fun!)
- Engaging in pet web-design projects, such as this site, which is designed from scratch using HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and the Hugo framework.
