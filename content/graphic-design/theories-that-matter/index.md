In 2018, I was invited to offer a guest lecture on new materialism in Dr. Mary P. Sheridan's graduate course "Theories that Matter." New materialism--a scholarly area intersecting philosophy, [media studies](/tags/media-studies), and rhetoric--was a central focus of my [doctoral dissertation](/research/dissertation) and my article in [*Rhetoric Review*](/research/disidentification-and-documentation). My lecture focused on:
- the defining features of new materialist thinking,
- its relation to other intellectual areas and trends,
- and how it might help us understand communication and documentation practices.

The handout below was designed to supplement the talk and give students in the course an accessible entry point for some of the thinkers I discussed. I created it using Adobe InDesign.
