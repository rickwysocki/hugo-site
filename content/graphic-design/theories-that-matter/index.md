In 2018, I was invited to offer a guest lecture on new materialism in Dr. Mary P. Sheridan's graduate course "Theories that Matter." New materialism--a recent scholarly area intersecting philosophy, media studies, and rhetoric--was a central focus of my [doctoral dissertation](/research/dissertation) and my article in [*Rhetoric Review*](/research/disidentification-and-documentation). My lecture focused the defining features of new materialist thinking and their relation to other intellectual trends.

The handout below was designed to supplement the talk and give students in the course an accessible entry point for some of the thinkers I discussed. I created it using Adobe InDesign.
