This is a quick post, but I just posted a working version of my first
Hugo theme to Github, titled
[Little Ghost](https://github.com/rickwysocki/littleGhost). I've got a
lot of updates to work on and push to the repository (including
finishing the documentation), but I'm pretty proud of what's there so
far. Give it a check, if you feel so inclined.
