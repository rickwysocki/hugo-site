As you see, I've fully left Ghost and built out a Hugo site. [My previous post](/posts/2023-03-10-hugo/) (actually unpublished until now) detailed some of the thinking that went into building this site and the reasons for the switch. I'm still planning to release the final version as a little theme, but just need to finish getting things squared away on my actual site (here) first.

A few of the main things I'm going to be working on here include migrating both all my old blog posts and (probably more interesting) a lot of my teaching materials here for folks. A few thinks are posted under [Teaching](/teaching/) currently, but there is a lot more to come.

Unrelated to the site, it was my birthday a few days ago. I figured I'd detail some of the nice things that happened this year.

- A and I got engaged!
- I spent a week at the Rochester Zen Center in sesshin (a Zen method of silent, intensive meditation over a period of days). A very transformative experience.
- A taught a number of really successful courses.
- I saw a lot of good friends get married.
- Relatedly, A and I were able to do some traveling this past year, previously being more locked down due to the pandemic. Looking forward to doing more.
- I made a lot of progress in weight-lifting, and ran a successful 10k the day after my birthday.

These are only a few good things, and a longer list would include lots more. Next steps this summer include wedding planning!
