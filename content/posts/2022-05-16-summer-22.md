I submitted grades last week, and it's officially the start of the summer. I took a few days to mess around and decompress but have now started getting into some summer projects in force. A few things I hope to be working on:

- A lot of Zen practice. (Including, if things go according to plan, my first formal sesshin in July.)
- Finally learning Javascript in a deep way, after putting off going past the basics for an extremely long time.
- Getting my courses prepped.
- Finally putting out a short EP of some of the music I've been throwing together for the past year or so.
- Lots of random work around the house.
- Lifting weights, of course.

Besides the above, I'm hoping to start blogging a bit more about programming, both as I learn more about Javascript and also about my Max/MSP/Jitter programming for the odd computer music / digital art nerd that might be reading this. I might also be writing the odd post about films now that I have more time to watch them. Yesterday, I finally jumped into the Criterion Collection's Japanese Noir catalog with *Take Aim at the Police Van.*

Probably biting off more than I can chew, but that's the plan so far.
