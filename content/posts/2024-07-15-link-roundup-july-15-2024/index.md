This week, I've included a new article and a much older one. The first focuses on ways that organizations can set up technical writers to be successful in their work. The second offers a waterfall of advice for reflective self-management over a career. 

As always, I generate summaries using AI and edit those summaries for accuracy and usefulness. Then, I offer some thoughts of my own.

## Fabrizio Ferri Benedetti, "How to set up your tech writer for success"

[Link to Article](https://passo.uno/how-to-tech-writer-success/)

### Generated Summary (ChatGPT)

Ferri Bendetti argues that to set a technical writer up for success,
ensure they have adequate access to information, a robust documentation
toolchain, and integrate them into the development process. Encourage a
documentation-first approach, involve them in AI development, and help
them break down content silos. Providing these resources and fostering
collaboration will enable your technical writer to significantly enhance
product usability and communication.

### My Thoughts:

This is a great article for audiences that are unfamiliar with the value
of writers and what they need in technical environments. I especially
appreciate Fabrizio Ferri Benedetti's comments about the need to develop
effective, collaborative toolchains for documentation and the importance
of centering writers and humanities perspectives when creating and
employing AI tools in the workplace (which I've noted across several of
[my own posts on AI](/tags/artificial-intelligence/). Ferri Bendetti's pithy blog post really cuts to the
core of how important writers are for organizations in a succinct and
straightforward way.

## Peter F. Drucker, "Managing Oneself"

[Link to Article](https://hbr.org/2005/01/managing-oneself)

### Generated Summary (ChatGPT)

This article, published in the Harvard Business Review, emphasizes the
importance of self-awareness and self-management in achieving success.
Drucker argues that individuals must understand their strengths, how
they perform best, their values, and where they can make the greatest
contribution. By taking responsibility for their own development and
managing their relationships effectively, individuals can navigate their
careers more successfully. He also stresses the importance of knowing
when to change course and the need for continuous learning and
self-improvement.

## My Thoughts

This article is a bit older, but I hadn't read it before. Given my
background in philosophy, I don't throw the word "wisdom" around
loosely. That said, though, this article comes extremely close.
Drucker's thoughts on self-management go well beyond the "business
self-help" genre and offer life advice that can apply to seemingly any
human activity. There's too much to touch on in one link roundup, but
I'll highlight Drucker's heuristic for activities that make a
difference---difficult, meaningful, and measurable---as especially
useful. I can see this heuristic, alone, as a start to a goal-setting
session at multiple levels, regardless of whether those goals are
counted in weeks or years and whether they are personal or
organizational.
