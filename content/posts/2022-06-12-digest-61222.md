My first digest post! Here's a rundown of my recent posts, as well as a few things I've liked this week.

## My Stuff:

- ["Masculinity in *Shane* and *Yojimbo*."](/film/masculinity-shane-and-yojimbo/) Some recollections on these two films, the genres of the western and the samurai films, and masculinity in the above. Bonus: a (compassionate) rant about graduate school.
- ["Superheroes: Ritual or Ideology?"](/film/heroes-ritual-and-ideology/). Are movies trying to snag your money and turn you into a social automaton, or are they trying to help you understand the world around you? Can you enjoy them without being a sucker? Read to find out!

## Other Stuff:

* Movie of the Week: [*Perfect Blue*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0156887/). I'm reading for a post about Satoshi Kon, whose work I love. I finally watched *Perfect Blue*, and it was at the same time so engaging and so haunting. More to come.
* Song of the Week: ["Ruby" by Hovvdy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNqhu0fqYBo). This song is off the band's very recent EP *billboard for my feelings*. It does a really nice job of capturing what I love about happy, playful indie rock without making me feel like I'm going to be annoyed by an episode of *Scrubs.* The whole EP is worth a list, but this song was the standout track for me.
* Article of the Week: ["Alan Cummingâ€™s Beloved Chimp Found After Owner Admits to Faking Death."](https://www.indiewire.com/2022/06/alan-cummings-chimp-found-1234730752/) I'll usually try to offer something more substantial in this category, but the story here is too weird not to share. Am I reading correctly that the chimp has a tablet and a bigger TV than I do?
