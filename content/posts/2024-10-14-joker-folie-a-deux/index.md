I have to assume that *Joker 2: Folie à Deux* lacked what audiences
loved about Todd Phillip's first *Joker* film. The assumption is
necessary, because I didn't like the first film either. I found the
breathless discourse about the earlier movie as ridiculous as most
normal people did. But I *was* put off by its "don't cut yourself on my
edge" ethos, which was---truthfully---a bit boring.

This one, though. *This one, though.* There is always a recency bias
when dealing superlatively, but I haven't come up with a more
frustrating movie than *Folie à Deux* since seeing it in the theater.
Don't call its narrative difficult. Don't call its genre bending
unbounded. Don't call its refusal of expectations an creative choice by
cinematic *auteur.* Audiences should refuse back, because every one of
these decisions is, today, precisely what makes this film so uncreative.

*Folie à Deux* bets all of its chips on genre bending as interesting and
subverting expectations as radical. It *begs* the audience to audience
to accept. *But folks. It is 2024.* These are a few trailers that showed
before *Joker*:

-   *Kraven the Hunter.* A Marvel movie that is also an R-rated, violent
    revenge film.
-   *Red One.* A Christmas Santa-Claus movie that is also an action
    movie that is also a comedy movie and that is also clearly following
    the Marvel formula.
-   *Venom:* *The Last Dance.* A superhero movie that (whoa guys)
    *isn't* a Marvel film. This one's dark.

*Folie à Deux*, blending genres like the musical, the psychological
thriller, and--*again!*--the superhero movie, pleads with viewers to
accept that it is novel, radical, different.

The problem is, it's not. Today, the genre-bent movie *is the dominant
genre*. Subverted expectations *is the primary expectation of
audiences.* For crying out loud, M. Knight Shyamalan now regularly
*doesn't* put twists or ambiguity into his movies, which is more
surprising than if he had.

The remainder of *Folie à Deux*, beyond its undelivered-upon demands on
the audience, is boringly offensive and offensively boring. It would
honestly have been more surprising if this film had, after the first
*Joker*, just done the most normative superhero movie possible. I'm
talking spandex. I'm talking costumes with nipples, for some reason. I'm
talking *Zoinks! Boom! Pow!* All of this would have been more
interesting and, at this point, somehow more original than *Folie à
Deux.*

Let's stop making "wouldn't it be weird/cool/interesting if..." movies.
Good ones are good enough.
