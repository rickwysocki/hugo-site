One article?! Yes. And I am sorry. It's the first week of the semester,
and I've been working on a research project that's taken up a lot of my
independent reading/writing time. At the very least, I am also posting
an additional blog post I've been working on, which you can check out
[here](/posts/2024/08/stay-on-the-bus-or-optimization-is-a-dirty-word/).

As always, I generate summaries using AI and edit those summaries for
accuracy and usefulness. Then, I offer some thoughts of my own.
