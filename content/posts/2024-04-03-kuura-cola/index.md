I bought a few cakes of Kuura Cola without sampling them, as the tea gets recommended quite a bit online as a "daily drinker." I rarely drink coffee, and ripe puer is my substitute. It's forgiving to brew "grandpa-style" in my thermos and to take with me all day. Oddly, I've found Kuura Cola to break that typical mold. It really benefits from gongfu-style brewing. 

Cola is a pretty standard ripe puer tea, which doesn't mean it isn't good. It's got very sweet notes and very little ripe puer "funk." Vanilla is the most dominant flavor to my pallate, and the soup is very thick and dark. Their website claims that drinkers may pick up sweet wood, as well, but I get much less of a sense of woodiness. (This may have something to do with Lumberslut being among my favorite teas, which is... not subtle in terms of woody flavor profiles.) I could see Cola being a good introduction to puer, and also a good option for weaning yourself off of coffee. This is hearty tea.

According to Kuura, Cola is a blend of puer leaves, fermented in 2018/2019 and pressed in 2020. There isn't too much else in the way of information, other than that Kuura typically sources from Xishuangbanna. This lack of information is somewhat convenient for me, a new enthusiast for a hobby that is _notorious_ for misinformation and spurious claims to origin. The lack of specificity makes things easy.

Things were a bit less simple in learning how I liked to brew this tea, though. Kuura mentions giving the cake time to settle, and I strongly agree. Truthfully, I hated the tea when I first sampled it. It tasted very mineral-y, which I don't dislike out of pocket but which was overpowering to the point of almost tasting salty. Once I gave the tea a few weeks to rest, though, the minerality faded and the sweeter notes became much more evident.

The other surprising thing I learned is that this tea _really_ shines when brewed gongfu, and that I don't particularly like it when brewed grandpa-style. Many folks online are very... evangelist about gongfu brewing, which makes sense because it is a wonderful method to brew tea. That said, I am very persuaded by those who note that gongfu brewing is:

1. A relatively new phenomenon.
2. Not the way most people in the world drink tea.

I just find myself drinking grandpa-style more often, not only because of the convenience but because many teas taste better to me when brewed grandpa-style.

Kuura Cola is not one of those teas. I love it when brewed gongfu, but so far the grandpa-style brews end up reactivating the minerality that I initially found off-putting.

All that said, I'm enjoying the tea. I've got a few sessions left of the first cake and then am planning to let the second one sit for a while and see what I think then.
