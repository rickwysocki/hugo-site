So, I'm learning Hugo.

This is a really fun framework, and I've learned more in about a week designing this site than I may ever have in such a condensed period of time.

There's still a lot to do, though:

1. I'm done some fine design stuff here, but I really want to get the template set up with the Node version of Bootstrap so that I can do more related to customizing site-wide variables.
2. I need to get all the SEO stuff squared away.
3. Obviously, set up .git to do versioning, especially. A good time to get that done is when I get Node running and start playing with bootstrap's default variables.
4. Figure out how to set up a light / dark mode toggle.
5. Make sure images and all that work fine.
6. Eventually, I'd like to package this all up as a theme to show off as a project, so I'm sure there is lots that I don't know that I don't know yet related to that.
7. Figure out featured images.
8. Figure out the Open Graph stuff.

Ideas for the theme name? Here's a few off-the-top:

- Super Simple Hugo
