As you see, I've fully left Ghost and built out a Hugo site.
[My previous post](/posts/2023-03-10-hugo/) detailed some of the
thinking that went into this site and the reasons for the switch. I'm
still planning to release the final version as a little theme, but just
need to finish getting things squared away on my actual site (here)
first.

I'm going to be working on here include migrating both all my old blog
posts and other material here.

Unrelated to the site, it was my birthday a few days ago. I figured I'd
detail some of the nice things that happened this year.

-   A and I got engaged!
-   I spent a week at the Rochester Zen Center in sesshin (a Zen method of
    silent, intensive meditation over a period of days). A very
    transformative experience.
-   A taught a number of really successful courses.
-   I saw a lot of good friends get married.
-   Relatedly, A and I were able to do some traveling this past year,
    previously being more locked down due to the pandemic. Looking forward
    to doing more.
-   I made a lot of progress in weightlifting, and ran a successful 10k
    the day after my birthday.

These are only a few good things, and a longer list would include lots
more. Next steps this summer include wedding planning!
