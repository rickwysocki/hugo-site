It's honestly sort of comical that I'm including these two articles in
the same link roundup. They reflect the extreme polarities of my
interests. The first is a 1998 interview with Paul Virilio, a theorist
of media and technology with extraordinary skepticism about the logics
and effects of technical progress. The second is a blog post about ways
to make better decisions. Ultimately, I'm just a guy with very wide
reading interests who is also trying to get stuff done. Like I said,
these articles reflect that.

As always, I generate summaries using AI and edit those summaries for
accuracy and usefulness. Then, I offer some thoughts of my own.

## Paul Virilio, "Surfing the Accident: Interview with Paul Virilio by Andreas Ruby"

[Link to Article](https://v2.nl/articles/surfing-the-accident)

### Generated Summary (ChatGPT)

In this interview, Paul Virilio discusses the evolving nature of
accidents in modern society. He differentiates between localized,
industrial accidents of the past and the emerging \"integral accident\"
of the digital age, which is global and systemic. Virilio argues that
while traditional accidents could be contained, modern accidents are
pervasive and interconnected, challenging our ability to control them.
He views accidents as an inevitable part of technological progress and
warns that we must learn to live with these risks rather than seek to
eliminate them.

### My Thoughts

It is heartening to me that, given the topic and Virilio's general
stance toward technology, the initial summary ChatGPT generated for the
interview was absolutely terrible. It is pretty much unquestionable that
Virilio would have nothing but disdain for ChatGPT. What is more
interesting to me, though, is how this interview from 1998 gives a sense
of his orientation toward progress more succinctly than his writing. He
begins by outlining the historical progression from the localized
technical accident (e.g., a train crash) toward the integral, global
accident that implicates all of us (e.g., the effects of network
technology on the environment). What is fascinating, though, is his
insistence that the goal is not to reject technological "progress" but
to wrestle with it, to face it directly. That's something that hasn't
come across quite as clearly in work I've read from Virilio, so I
appreciated this interview.

Beyond his insights, there are several nostalgia-inducing moments here from 1998, such as anxiety about the Millenium Bug and
references to Napster. Those, alone, make it worth reading.

## Max Stoiber, "How to be better at making decisions"

[Link to Article](https://mxstbr.com/notes/decision-making)

### Generated Summary

This article discusses strategies for improving decision-making by writing down your
thought process, prioritizing evaluation criteria, sharing decisions
with others for feedback, reflecting on past decisions, and learning
through deliberate practice, such as playing poker. Stoiber also
provides a decision log template to help structure and refine
decision-making. These practices aim to enhance clarity, speed, and
accuracy in both personal and professional contexts.

### My Thoughts

Much of the value of this post comes from Stoiber's decision log
template toward the end of the article. I think there's a lot of benefit
in finding ways to make your thinking material and explicit. Personally, I
 use a variety of techniques for this, such as the GTD system
for task management and a zettelkasten for writing. I think Stoiber's
heuristic for decision-making is worth giving a shot.
