The two article's I'm sharing this week both touch on how complexity emerges from simple systems, which is one of my own guiding interests.

As always, I generate summaries using AI and edit those summaries for accuracy and usefulness. Then, I offer some thoughts of my own.


## Caleb Gucciardi, "Complex Systems Emerge from Simple Rules"

Article](https://tecnica.substack.com/p/complex-systems-emerge-from-simple)

### Generated Summary (ChatGPT)

This article argues that biology, chemistry, and physics are emergent
properties arising from simpler rules and interactions. The concept of
emergence is illustrated using the "Game of Life," a cellular automaton
with four simple rules that produce complex and lifelike patterns from
simple initial conditions. The article extends this idea to real-world
systems and connects it to AI, specifically large language models like
GPT-3, which exhibit emergent properties by producing coherent text and
solving problems beyond their initial training. The future of AI is seen
as being shaped by emergent principles observed in nature. The author
reflects on human actions as emergent, pondering the origins and
triggers of thoughts and behaviors.

### My Thoughts

While this is a short article, it touches on a concept that I find
extremely important at a personal level: complexity as an emergent
property. [My early academic
research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07350198.2020.1727101)
focused on the emergent complexity of documentation and archives. I used
the at-that-time-fashionable ["new materialism"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_materialism) as a way of considering
the emergent properties involved in creating an archive and, in that
way, guiding history. (I don't mean any disrespect to new materialism, but it does seem to be a mode of thinking that---like many "hot"
intellectual topics---suffered from success.) In any case, this author
does a nice job explaining some of the basic ideas related to emergent
complexity in an accessible manner. I agree that it is worth seriously
considering the emergent nature of AI.

## John Carlos Baez, "Tritone Subsitutions"

[Link to
Article](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2024/07/27/tritone-substitutions/)

### Generated Summary (ChatGPT)

This post on tritone substitutions explores how this musical technique
can enhance the sophistication of compositions. It explains the basic
theory behind dominant seventh chords and how rotating their notes 180
degrees on a circle of fifths creates tritone substitutions. The post
includes diagrams and examples to illustrate the concept, and links to
videos for further learning. The article aims to make complex music
theory accessible and enjoyable, highlighting the role of tritone
substitutions in various musical genres.

### My Thoughts

So, this article may be "a lot" for non-musicians. What it's
highlighting, though, is that music---all of it---relies on a fairly
simple set of rules from which complexity (such as tritone substitution)
emerges. In that regard, music is perhaps *the best* example of what the
article above discussed. From rhythms to melodies, there are simple
systems that exist that, when experimented with appropriately, generate
the complexity of what we hear as music. The tritone substitution (a
fascinating bit of music theory) demonstrates just that sort of
experimentation.
