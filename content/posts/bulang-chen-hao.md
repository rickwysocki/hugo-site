Liquid Proust

Drank on April 3, rainy day evening session.

The leaves broke up really nice.

I used 10 grams in 100 ml gaiwan to use up some remaining leaves in the
sample. Flash steeps.

Young puer sour smell on the wet leaves.

Tasted somewhere between a slightly aged and young puer. Could taste the
"grandma's house" notes behind the astringency, similar to Love Forever.

Not too think and not too light of a mouthfeel.

Vegetal and floral. Mossy smell, with grass and hay notes. Sort of like
stepping out of a tent in the woods and smelling the dew.

Somewhat astringent, but surprisingly tame for the 10 gram dose.

A few steeps in I started feeling a very calm and float-y energy. In
steeps past that, it turned radically and become much more energetic.

Strong huigan that emerged a few steeps in and remained even in later
steeps once the tea became lighter.
