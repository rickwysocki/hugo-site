Today will be a shorter post. Rather than write, I spent most of the day a) submitting grades and b) working on a new track (see below). But here are a few quick notes.

- I feel much better today than I have in previous days. And my taste and smell have almost entirely returned.
- A's still testing negative. (!)
- A also bought me clam chowder at the store. It was perfect.
- Last night I watched *Twelve Monkeys*. It was extremely odd. I really enjoyed it.

Finally, as I said, I spent some time making music in Ableton today, which was nice. I posted a rough cut of the track to SoundCloud, embedded below.

Sick-cerely,

Rick
