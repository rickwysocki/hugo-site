I remark often that I was in the last pre-LMS generation. For those
unfamiliar, LMS stands for learning management system, and these systems
are an extremely lucrative industry in higher education. A quick Google
search lets me know the average cost per year for a university is
\$75,000, and that this figure doesn't include the attendant hosting
fees, support personnel, ADA compliance officers, and a variety of other
ancillary costs.

The integration of the LMS and their assumed centrality to teaching
happened sometime while I was in graduate school. When I was studying
literature in college from 2009-2013--_shit, statements like that are
the beginning of the end, aren't they?_--classes essentially worked
like this:

-   A teacher handed out a course schedule and a syllabus at the
    beginning of the semester. I always read the former and skimmed the
    latter for required books I needed to buy. I truly, honestly cannot
    remember ever reading anything else on a syllabus besides the course
    title.
-   On a day-to-day basis, teachers would remind students of what was
    due by the next class. Usually, these were readings. If I wasn't
    paying attention (a typical situation by the way---this isn't a
    *kids these days* screed) I would look at the aforementioned course
    schedule, which was probably in my bedroom somewhere. If not, I
    imagine I found another copy. I don't remember how.
-   Sometimes, the teacher would then hand out other sheets of paper
    called assignments. They would explain the assignments, and then
    students would go do them to the best of their ability, meeting with
    the teacher during their office hours as necessary.
-   A grade was given at the end of the semester. Given that I never
    read a syllabus, the way these were calculated remains something of
    a mystery to me.

Essentially, the entire course was managed by teacher circulating
print-based documents in class. This was a highly imperfect system for
all sorts of reasons. But there are a few things it encouraged that were
highly positive: attending class, the value of listening (even though,
as mentioned, I often wasn't), personal organization, and in-person
interaction with a teacher.

I remember my first introduction to an LMS. A literature professor used
Blackboard (a popular LMS), which she correctly identified as the future
of education. She still circulated all the same documents, though, and I
tried my best to ignore Blackboard.

Eventually, we were required to take an in-class quiz using her LMS, and
I could ignore it no longer. We were told to bring a computer to class,
which seemed very dumb to me in the context of a literature course.
Wasn't it easier just to take the quiz on paper? Whatever. I opened up
the quiz on Blackboard and reviewed the questions. I was sitting at the
back of the room and looked up. What I saw was about 75% of students
cheating on the quiz.

**Dear Critical Reader:** I do not think all or most students, in
general, are cheating. I'll go even further and say that I think quizzes
on literary texts are, themselves, a largely unproductive genre. And if
a teacher is giving a quiz proctored through a networked computer,
honestly, whatever happens happens. That's on you.

It's just the case that almost everyone on that day was cheating. And it
set the tone---fairly or unfairly---for my view on these systems in
general. Learning management systems solve a lot of problems. And they
certainly enable important interactions for online classes. But for
in-person classes, they've fostered a "web-first" assumption on the part
of teachers *and* students that, in the final account, bad.

It's bad because it affords new types of cheating, sure, but I don't
really care much about that. These systems are truly bad several other reasons:

-   **Reason 1.** They completely alter the relationship between
    teachers and students, putting an incredibly poorly designed
    technology between them and telling both parties that they "solve"
    the "problem" of course communication.
-   **Reason 2:** They track everything students and teachers do on and
    with them. This is both a privacy issue and a labor issue.
-   **Reason 3:** They tell their audiences that their primary purpose
    is **Reason 1** when it is actually **Reason 2**. **Reason 2**
    provides data that is given back to both universities and private
    companies, which they then use/sell to earn profits in ways that are
    not only unrelated to but often in opposition to teaching and
    learning.
-   **Reason 4:** Students, when you ask them, don't even like these
    systems.
-   **Reason 5:** The LMS are now *widely assumed to be the class
    itself,* not a tool used by a teacher within a larger class setting.
    This is demonstrated constantly by the language that surrounds them.
    Before the semester: "Do you have your class posted?" "Yeah I'm
    almost there. I just need to work on my classes a bit."

I've taken to call this LMS-assumption "content management pedagogy."
Content management, to be clear, is the productive and necessary technical writing
skill of managing and designing content for users. Content management
pedagogy is the typically unproductive and less-necessary phenomenon
where the processing and management of course material becomes
unconsciously synonymous with teaching and learning. Content management
pedagogy is evident when teachers are forced to spend valuable time
(that could be used to design learning activities, for instance) updating overly
complicated and borderline legalistic documents across multiple sections
of a single course. Content management pedagogy accounts for the feeling that
we're teaching online courses when we're *in* the classroom, opening
online materials for in-person students who all have computers or
phones. Content management pedagogy is what trains us all that a
20-email thread to **not** answer a question is flexible, accommodating
efficiency, while answering that same question in four seconds in class
is limiting.

The culprit here is, and never could be, students or teachers. It's that
technology changes the delivery of learning. It's the LMS. And it's bad.
