It's midsummer. I'm fresh off a one-day retreat at the Zen center here and looking back on a fairly solid week. As usual, see below for a review of both "my stuff" and "other stuff."

## My Stuff:

- ["*Satoyama*, Modernity, and Tradition in Japanese Anime."](/film/satoyama/) A few comments on my burgeoning interest in anime and the fascinating Japanese term "satoyama."
- ["Whinging Poetic: Sci-Fi and Gattaca"](/film/sci-fi-whinge/). Gattaca is bad. Or maybe I'm bad. Read for my thoughts.

## Other Stuff:

* Movie of the Week: [*Black Bear*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9601220/). We watched this movie a few months back and I really enjoyed it. The well-explored themes of the artistic process, drafting, and creative breakdown were presented in a really fresh and interesting way. Plus, Aubrey Plaza rules.
* Song of the Week: ["Go Away" by cumgirl8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0g1DUHjjuQ). A great song from a wonderfully obscene punk band. Integrates some solid '90s vibes but still manages to not feel dated. Check it out.
* Article of the Week: ["Climate Change is Turning More of Central Asia into Desert."](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01667-2) Depressing and scary stuff, as all climate news is. One of the quoted ecologists calls their study a "great first step" toward steps to reduce the deleterious effects of climate disruption. Take this jaded-ness with a grain of salt, but I will not be holding my breath for the second step.
