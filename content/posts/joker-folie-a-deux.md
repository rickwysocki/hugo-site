I have to assume that _Joker 2: Folie à Deux_ lacked what audiences
loved about Todd Phillip's first _Joker_ film. The assumption is
necessary, because I didn't like the first film either. I found the
breathless discourse about the earlier movie as ridiculous as most
normal people did. But I _was_ put off by its "don't cut yourself on my
edge" ethos, which was---truthfully---a bit boring.

This one, though. _This one, though._ There is always a recency bias
when dealing superlatively, but I haven't come up with a more
frustrating movie than _Folie à Deux_ since seeing it in the theater.
Don't call its narrative difficult. Don't call its genre bending
unbounded. Don't call its refusal of expectations an creative choice by
cinematic _auteur._ Audiences should refuse back, because every one of
these decisions is, today, precisely what makes this film so uncreative.

_Folie à Deux_ bets all of its chips on genre bending as interesting and
subverting expectations as radical. It _begs_ the audience to audience
to accept. _But folks. It is 2024._ These are a few trailers that showed
before _Joker_:

-   _Kraven the Hunter._ A Marvel movie that is also an R-rated, violent
    revenge film.
-   _Red One._ A Christmas Santa-Claus movie that is also an action movie
    that is also a comedy movie and that is also clearly following the
    Marvel formula.
-   _Venom:_ _The Last Dance._ A superhero movie that (whoa guys) _isn't_
    a Marvel film. This one's dark.

_Folie à Deux_, blending genres like the musical, the psychological
thriller, and--_again!_--the superhero movie, pleads with viewers to
accept that it is novel, radical, different.

The problem is, it's not. Today, the genre-bent movie _is the dominant
genre_. Subverted expectations _is the primary expectation of
audiences._ For crying out loud, M. Knight Shyamalan now regularly
_doesn't_ put twists or ambiguity into his movies, which is more
surprising than if he had.

The remainder of _Folie à Deux_, beyond its undelivered-upon demands on
the audience, is boringly offensive and offensively boring. It would
honestly have been more surprising if this film had, after the first
_Joker_, just done the most normative superhero movie possible. I'm
talking spandex. I'm talking costumes with nipples, for some reason. I'm
talking _Zoinks! Boom! Pow!_ All of this would have been more
interesting and, at this point, somehow more original than _Folie à
Deux._

Let's stop making "wouldn't it be weird/cool/interesting if..." movies.
Good ones are good enough.
