In graduate school, I took a course on film genre. I enjoyed the class,
but I wish I'd engaged with it more. At the time, it felt a bit more
like an "elective," unrelated to my dissertation research on LGBTQ
social movement rhetoric. This was a mistake. It may be specific to my
field, and it's almost certainly tied to the current academic job
market, but I've noticed that graduate students (myself included)
over-professionalize and over-specialize, often extremely early in their
Ph. D.

With 20-20 hindsight, I've been going through some of my notes from that
film genre class. It was well-designed: each week, we watched two or
three films from a particular genre and read a bit of genre theory to
help us understand them. Often, the films crossed nations or other sorts
of borders, showing just how complicated film genre can be.

One week, we watched _Shane_ and _Yojimbo_ as cross-cultural examples of
the Western, which is historically connected to the samurai film in
Japan. Both films are titled based on the names of their protagonists
and, in each case, the narrative focuses on a male figure entering a
town on a "frontier." Barry Langford noted that within the Western genre
the frontier depicts a sort of between-ness, "not a clear boundary
but . . . uncertain and shifting" (63). This is apparent in both _Shane_
and _Yojimbo_, each film narrating a man in a transforming social
environment, mediating between the "old" and the "new."

The "man" of it all is important. Both films rely on a return--or at
least an echo--of a supposedly "authentic" masculinity. The first battle
between Seibei and Ushitora illustrates this: Yojimbo sits on a tower
laughing as the two gangs scare each other but are unable to actually
fight. Alternatively, Shane explains to Joey that a real gunfighter only
needs one pistol (setting himself apart from the "Black hat" villain who
uses two) and later relates to Marion that guns are mere tools to be
used by good or bad men. _Yojimbo_ takes a similar stance, one step
removed: the sword wielded by the good man is juxtaposed against the
villain with the pistol.

There are, of course, important contextual differences in these films'
representations of masculinity. As Randy P. Schiff wrote, _Yojimbo_ is
invested in Japanese class identity and in "a credit economy that has
advanced nearly to the point where it will destroy the social role of
the samurai itself" (66). By contrast, the social struggle in _Shane_ is
marked more heavily by ideologies of land and private property. Each
hero embodies ideological features of their respective country,
mediating changing historical contexts and relations.
