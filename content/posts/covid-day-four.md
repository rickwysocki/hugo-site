Today will be a shorter post. Rather than write, I spent most of the day
a) submitting grades and b) working on a new track (see below). But here
are a few quick notes.

-   I feel much better today than I have in previous days. And my taste
    and smell have almost entirely returned.
-   A's still testing negative. (!)
-   A also bought me clam chowder at the store. It was perfect.
-   Last night I watched _Twelve Monkeys_. It was extremely odd. I really
    enjoyed it.

Finally, as I said, I spent some time making music in Ableton today,
which was nice. I posted a rough cut of the track to SoundCloud,
embedded below.

Sick-cerely,

Rick
