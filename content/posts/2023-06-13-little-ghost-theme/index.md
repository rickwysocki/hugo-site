This is a quick post, but I just put posted a working version of my first Hugo theme to Github, titled [Little Ghost](https://github.com/rickwysocki/littleGhost). I've got a lot of updates to keep working on and push to the repository (including finishing the documentation), but I'm pretty proud of what's there so far. Give it a check, if you feel so inclined.
