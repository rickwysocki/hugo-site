## Description

I developed Little Ghost, a simple theme for static site generator and content management framework Hugo. Designed for blogs and portfolio websites, the theme offers Hugo's powerful content management features in an easy and aesthetically pleasing design.

This theme, available on [Github](https://github.com/rickwysocki/littleghost), showcases two of my skills:

- Technical documentation.
- Web design.

Since this project really represents two distinct skill-sets, I've provided two separate project narratives below.

## Little Ghost: Technical Documentation

I had three goals when I decided to create Little Ghost.

1. **Simplifying:** I have spent many years using static site generators. I _love_ immersing myself in the technical documentation for platforms like Jekyll and Hugo, and over time I have internalized a great deal of technical knowledge related to these platforms. But I know that not everyone feels similarly about technical pursuits, and I wanted a theme that would offer simplicity for users.
2. **Learning:** As readers of my site will surely notice, I have something of an addiction to learning. I wanted to use this project to expand my understanding not only of web design (see below) but also of how to communicate technical concerns in documentation.
3. **Sharing:** Perhaps obviously, I wanted to share what I learned in designing the theme.

Based on these goals, the technical documentation increasingly became central to the project.

While it would have been easy and conventional to use Markdown for Little Ghost's documentation, I chose to write in AsciiDoc for a simple reason: I was, at the time, less familiar with it. I wanted to learn something new in documenting the theme. In the process, I found several benefits, such as:
- Using AsciiDoc's admonitions to provide an additional level of information to users.
- Employing the conditional logic available in AsciiDoc syntax. For example, I used conditional statements to format the document correctly and logically on GitHub.
- Applying syntax highlighting, making code blocks easier to understand.



## Little Ghost: Hugo Theme

I created this theme using my knowledge of [HTML5/CSS](/skills/html5-/-css) as well as [Go](/skills/go), the programming language on which Hugo is built. I start with Bootstrap, but much of what is happening in the design goes well beyond "out of the box" Bootstrap, including offering users SCSS variables to customize the look and feel of their site, rich front-matter configurations for posts and pages, and nearly automatic search-engine optimization.
